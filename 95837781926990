Page 37 of RFC 883 discusses QCLASS=*.

One question I have is about the meaning of the sentence
	"The name error condition is not meaningful for a QCLASS=*
	 query."
What exactly does that mean?  Does that mean the server should not
generate a name error, or that the resolver should not believe any
name error that is returned?  Or both?

I did just a little poking around.  SRI-NIC.ARPA and XX.LCS.MIT.EDU both
generate non-authoritative name errors when asking for Address records
for names in zones they are authoritative for.  

BITSY.MIT.EDU, on the other hand, returns an authoritative name error.
This also seems to go against the second paragraph, which states it can
be done by resetting the authoritative bit and performing the query in
the classes that are loaded.

Constructively: I suggest that the spec be changed so that BITSY's
action is correct and the NIC's and XX's action is incorrect.
Specifically, I suggest that all the data for a given name of all
classes reside together in the same database.  In practice, I don't
think this is incompatible with any existing situations.  In theory, I
think having different class information reside in different places was
a failed experiment and that ideally all the data about a name/object
should reside together.  This would allow QCLASS=* to have authoritative
meaning, and would be useful, for example, to find all the addresses of
a host, not just Internet addresses.
