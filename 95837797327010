In article &lt;7856@mirsa.inria.fr&gt;, huitema@jerry.inria.fr (Christian

|&gt;For example, the FR domain contains some commercial subnets which are
|&gt;connected to the French infrastructure, but are not allowed to use the
|&gt;NSFNET; listing their sites in the MX records would be very helpful in
|&gt;France, but would be very unfriendly to our US partners, which will get
|&gt;the info (MX, A, etc), but will see their connection attempts fail
|&gt;because "this net is unreachable".

Why is this a problem? What's wrong with having multiple MX'ers, one or two
reachable only from within France, the other one reachable from
"everywhere", and
with the french ones having the highest preference? That way you let the
IP level
decide on the routing (which it's designed for) and figure out the reachability
of the MX'ers.  Sure, the SMTP senders in the US (and elsewhere,
probably) would
not be able to connect directly to (some of) the french MX'ers, but as long as
there's a reachable MX'er in the list of possible MX'ers there should be no
problem as the sending mail system is required to try all the listed MX'ers in
turn.  Quoting from RFC1123, page 64:

	"When it succeeds, the mapping can result in a list of alternative
	delivery addresses rather than a single address, because of (a) multiple
	MX records, (b) multihoming, or both. To provide reliable mail 	
	transmission, the sender-SMTP MUST be able to try (and retry) each of
	the addresses in this list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds."

There is of course some "unnecessary" information introduced by this (MX and A
information that's "useless" from the sender's point of view) and some
unnecessary resource use (mainly some useless tcp SYNs and ICMP Unreachables),
but I think that is a small problem. 

The same arguments apply to the German situation.
