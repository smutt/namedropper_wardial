&gt;The problem with this is, what happens when snmpd or one of its

&gt;snmpd is already dead :-). Serouisly, you don't want to have to
&gt;build support for snmp into all of your deamons, you want snmp
&gt;to support your deamons, and if your snmp deamon dies - your sunk.

Yes, exactly..

my idea was to have a very simple generic daemon for monitoring other
daemons.  Hopefully this would also translate into small size which
ought to make it easier to debug and make sure that *IT* was a "safe"
program unlikely to crash, etc.

The System V init with /etc/inittab is close.  It doesn't do some of
the things I want.  For instance if a process normally exits occasionally
it might be good to check its exit status to see if it's a "real" problem
or not, and act differently.  In any case there should be logging to
some place, be it e-mail or syslog or whatever.  I'm reasonably sure that
the SysV init doesn't log anywhere .. after all, it's for running getty's
and why would you want to know when they exit?

Oh.. and obviously you have to rewrite all those daemons so they don't
do anti-social things like detach from the controlling process.


&gt;I think I shall tack David's daemon manager onto my TODO list.
&gt;Unfortunately, my TODO list has me booked into the next century
&gt;(I plan to take off the years 1999-2001, I don't want to be
&gt;anywhere near a computer when the century rolls :-).

My TODO list is just as long, believe me ...

I did hear of two things.  One in SysVr4 (haven't bothered to look this
up in the documentation yet..) is the Service Access Facility.

The other is from either Cornell or CMU (I forget, and I've deleted
that piece of mail) is a program called "nanny".  *great* name at least!
