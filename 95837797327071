i think this is our difference.  i believe the primary for the domain
gives the sub-domain (and reverse) away.  i also believe that by
changing a secondary to primary they can take it back.  if there's a
problem and the central organization wants to fix it they can.  my
presumption is problems can be fixed so why encourage unnecessary
centralization.

the unpleasant authority is not my main concern.  i feel like you're
encouraging centralization for its own sake.  my point is -- if
the sub-domain can fend for itself it should.  in fact it should be
encouraged to do so.  i think people on top of the situation should
have the flexibility to deal with it at least until they demonstrate
their inability to do so.

delegation of authority does not mean abdication of responsibility.
