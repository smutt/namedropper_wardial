   From: pcg@odin.UUCP  (Piercarlo Grandi)

You oughtn't put non-qualified local host names in the Path: line of
articles; the mailing list gateways use them for From: lines. Now,
odin is not a registered UUCP host, but thor (which fouled me up when
I last replied to you) is registered as the name of a host in Milford,
Ohio, U.S.A.. Also, if a site has a local host with the same name,
some IDA sendmail configurations will append the local domain when
receiving such mail.
[ This has been a brief excursion into matters of UUCP naming. ]

   When I get a reply from the Internet, it might/should be addressed as
   (assuming that the Internet side of the gateway uses % as a synonym for
   @ as well):

	   pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.Janet.net
	   pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.NRS.org
	   pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.ac.gb

That would be the most correct way of handling things. A pity that
nsfnet-relay does not choose to be known under any such name in the
DNS: neither janet.edu, nrs.org or gb exist. I assume that you were
joking?

   (which one do you think would be most appropriate, incidentally?) but
   not as

	   pcg@cs.aber.ac.uk

   which is not a legal Internet address (ironically it may be currently
   valid though, because of the double registration of Janet names in the
   NRS and the DNS, if I remember correctly).

Since the only way to get from Internet to Janet seems to be through
nsfnet-relay, and its only DNS name seems to be nsfnet-relay.ac.uk,
which is not a legal Internet host name either, we might as well use
the %-free form until such time as the Janet might decide to have
their gateways follow Internet rules on the Internet side.
