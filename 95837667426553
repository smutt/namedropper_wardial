Some members of the MIT Chaosnet community have suggested that chaos be
allocated a domain class.  The principal purpose, at least at present,
is to map between chaos net addresses and host names.

This message describes my perception of the issues in creating this new
class, but should not be taken as being an edict or even as a
preliminary design; I do hope that it encourages the Chaos community to
develop a standard which is compatible with the Internet domain class
and the domain protocols in general.  In any case, chaos deserves a
class regardless of what they do, and I have allocated class 3 and
acronym CH (for master file purposes).

For those unfamilar with Chaos, the basic idea is that we want to be
able to map between domain names for hosts and chaosnet address, which
are 16 bit numbers.  An additional problem is that there are multiple
chaosnet address spaces, which aren't connected, and hence there isn't
one space.

The general form of the proposed solution is that Chaos class type A RRs
include a Chaos system or net identifier of some sort along with the 16
bit address.  Note that the Chaos class is using exactly the same name
space as the Internet class, although the identical name space doesn't
imply that data will be present in both classes.  That is, if a host has
both a chaos and internet class adddresses it will have the same name in
both classes, though some hosts may well have RRs in only one class or
the other.  (Note that we assume that Chaos will encode types with
internet parallels identically with those of the Internet class.)

The choices which have been proposed for the Chaos net identifier are:

	1) A 16 bit encoded type.
	2) A domain name
	3) A variable length character string (similar to the HINFO data)

Since the Chaos community has a tradition of character strings, the
suggestion is the equivalent of a label, represeted using either (2) or
(3), where (3) seems to be a marginally better choice.  The label
restriction says that, by convention, the string will not contain
imbedded spaces or blanks, and will be 63 characters or less.

The address to name support requires the equivalent of the IN-ADDR.ARPA
domain.   The suggestion is that the address to name space for the chaos class
be of the form:

&lt;host number&gt;.&lt;subnet&gt;.&lt;chaos net id&gt;.&lt;origin&gt;

The &lt;host number&gt; field corresponds to the low order 8 bits of a
Chaosnet address.  The suggested format is a decimal string similar to
that used in the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain.  (Some want octal for historical
reasons.)

The &lt;subnet&gt; field corresponds to the high order 8 bits of a Chaosnet
address.  It will use the same representation as the &lt;host number&gt;.

The &lt;chaos net id&gt; is a label corresponding to the character strings in
the A RRs for class CH.  If the chaos net ID format changes, this too
will change.

The &lt;origin&gt; is a well known domain.  Perhaps 'CH-ADDR.&lt;something&gt;'.  In
any case, I'd rather have someone in the Chaos world pick it / get
others to accept it.

There are other major issues related to who will be responsible for the
chaos zone which effectively allocates the chaos net IDs, implementation
of this new zone's servers, etc., and refining the definition of the NS
and SOA RRs for this new environmen, but is seems worthwhile to solve
the multiple chaos problem first.

This first use of multiple classes should provide for interesting times.
