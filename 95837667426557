			     CALL FOR PAPERS

			ACM SIGCOMM '86 SYMPOSIUM
		 Communications Architectures and Protocols

			      Stowe, Vermont
			     August 5-7, 1986


The symposium provides an international forum for the presentation and
discussion of communication network applications and technologies, as
well as recent advances and proposals on communication architectures,
protocols, algorithms, and performance models.  Authors are invited to
submit full papers concerned with both theory and practice.  The areas
of interest for the symposium include, but are not limited to the
following: 

Computer network architectures and algorithms
Local area networks
Computer-based multimedia communications
Network interconnection
Packet radio networks
Satellite and wideband networks
Computer networking standards
Distributed operating systems
Protocol specification, verification, and analysis
Applications of computer networks (education, office automation,
banking, factory of the future)

Papers should be about 20 double-spaced pages long and should have an
abstract of 100-150 words.  All submitted papers will be reviewed and
will be judged with respect to their quality and relevance.  Authors
of selected papers will be expected to sign an ACM copyright release
form.  The Proceedings will be distributed at the symposium and
published as a special issue of SIGCOMM's Computer Communication
Review.  Since the proceedings of this conference will be widely
disseminated, publication is likely to inhibit republications in ACM's
refereed publications.  However, a few of the submitted papers will be
selected for publication in the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.

Submit 5 copies of each paper by February 15, 1986 to the co-program
chairman:  Dr. Jose J. Garcia Luna, SRI International, 333
Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA  94025, USA.
