We're in the process of trying to set up domain servers to do all The
Right Things, but we're at a loss as to what The Right Things are.

Schlumberger (SLB.COM) has two different nodes with gateways to the
outside world:  SPAR.SLB.COM is on the Internet, and SDR.SLB.COM is on
CSnet's phonenet.

Currently, the domain SLB.COM is handled by CSnet-relay.  It provides A
records for SPAR.SLB.COM and MX records for SDR.SLB.COM via CSnet-relay.

There is an internal X.25 pay-per-packet network (SInet) which includes
both these sites and many others.

The gateway between SPAR and the rest of the Internet is a Cisco box
which filters packets passing through in several ways:

1)  Nothing is allowed in from the Internet which is addressed for
SInet.

2)  Nothing is allowed out to the Interhet which comes from SInet.

3) Only certain packets are allowed in from the Internet to SPAR hosts.
This is changing, but in essence, Domain and SMTP service are allowed
through, Telnet and FTP are not.  Other services follow the same general
model.

SPAR wants to send/reiceve Internet mail directly to the Internet; SDR
wants to send/receive Internet mail via CSnet.  At the moment, other
SInet sites aren't in the equation, but we can assume that some will
want to use SDR as a mail relay, and some will want to use SPAR,
depending on which will have smaller packet charges.

In terms of what information we want advertised and where we want it
advertised:

Hosts on the Internet should have A records for hosts in SPAR.SLB.COM,
and WKS records for hosts in SPAR.SLB.COM that only includes the
services which can be used from the outside world and MX records for the
rest of SLB.COM either via CSnet or via SPAR.

Hosts on SInet, except for SPAR, should have full A and WKS records for
all of the hosts under SLB.COM.  It should also have MX records for the
Internet that will vary depending on site policy.

Hosts at SPAR should have access to both these databases, using the
Internet domain system for anything outside SLB.COM, and the internal
domain system for anything inside SLB.COM.

The hosts at SPAR are a mix of Suns and Symbolics Lisp Machines.  My
preference would be to run the local server on one of the Symbolics
machines so we can make use of the namespace system and eliminate
duplication of data, but if we can only do this using the Suns, I'll
back off on that issue.

My understanding of the domain RFCs is that SPAR cannot have a different
view of SLB.COM than the outside world does since hosts are supposed to
start at the root to find SDR.SLB.COM.  If I'm wrong here, how do we
splice a subtree from another domain system into our view of the
Internet domain system.  I'm also concerned about keeping the different
views of the universe from contaminating one another.

Any comments either on how this is supposed to work or how we can make
it work?
