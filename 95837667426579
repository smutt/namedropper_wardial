I have a few comments about your message:
	
	1) The serial field of the SOA RR for a domain is supposed to be a
	continuously increasing (mod 2**32) value which denotes the version of
	the database.  The idea is that you can tell that a zone has changed by
	comparing serial numbers.

Yep, we should do this and will in the future.
	
	5) Making up data.  For example, there are lots of servers who return
	RRs for the root servers with 99999999 in the TTL.  Some return RRs that
	suggest that ISIF is a root server.  (It was months ago, but is no
	longer.  I use it for testing.  I haven't updated its database since I
	started using it for testing.)

What are the official root nameservers?  I have received no word on any 
changes and still use ISIF as an alternate to SRI-NIC.ARPA.  
	
	9) The domain system is supposed to preserve case, but be case
	insensitive.  However, it does nobody any good to put both RRs for
	domain name xxx and XXX in the data base - It merely makes caching
	ambiguous and decreases the efficiency of compression.  This consistency
	should also exist in the duplicate RRs that mark delegation in the
	delegator and delegatee.  For example, if you ask the NIC to delegate
	UZOO.EDU to you, your database shouldn't say uzoo.edu.
	
We don't, but I had to write a case insensitive string comparision routine
and use it to fix login and rcmd.c on our unix system.  Dumbly they are
case sensitive about hostnames which may explain why some systems take
the easy way out.

Thanks for your comments.  They are appreciated.
