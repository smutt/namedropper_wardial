     I sure hope that when network protocols are designed the
primary concern is NOT what's best for Unix, even if the result
is nominally machine independent.  Protocols should not be
designed on the basis of what benefits 15 year old operating
systems, they should be designed on the basis of future
expectations as well as present realities.

     The host-address =&gt; host-name application you refer to is
not terribly useful as a security check; it is unreliable and
easy to misrepresent.  The TOPS-20 mailer has exactly the same
check in its SMTP server, but merely notes a validation failure
as a comment in the Received: header line.  It did so as an
artifact of ARPANET, where such checks were more than moderately
difficult to evade.  It would be no great tragedy if its ability
to do that went away these days; users should have a healthy
mistrust of the authenticity of what they receive in ordinary
netmail.  In some respect, I feel that such a check gives users a
false sense of security in the alleged authenticity of a netmail
message.

     Anyway, I think this is really straying from the intent of
namedroppers.  I would like to see a report from Paul Mockapetris
on the latest in what's happening wrt TOPS-20 namesolving.
