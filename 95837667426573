    We have recently received a request from Israel (domain IL) to
be one of their nameservers.  In addition they have asked us to provide
a somewhat special service, which has caused some mild debate
here, and we thought we would consult the interested parties on
the net for your views.

    The domain IL is expect to eventually contain several hundred
hosts (it currently has between 50 and 100), which are
accessible only for mail.  Most of those hosts are accessed via
RELAY.CS.NET, which forwards their mail via phone lines.  The
rest can be reached via EARN.

    As a result, the domain information for IL will only
contain MAIL information (no Internet addresses), and every
entry will simply be an MF RR, indicating that any mail to
the given IL domain name is to be forwarded via RELAY.CS.NET.
or some EARN gateway.

    The folks behind IL have expressed interest in just 
having us do a wildcard match -- i.e. any mailer asking about
any name ending in IL will just be told to pass it on to
RELAY.CS.NET for forwarding to Israel.  For hosts on
EARN we might keep a list of those hosts to forward specially.
In other words, we would not keep a list of the hundreds of hosts
in IL but would recognize any name ending in .IL as valid

    The major advantage is that we don't have to worry about
coordinating the host information for an entire country.  (Is
this name valid this week?).

    The one disadvantage is that we would be creating a section
of the domain space which is unverifiable.  You will never be
able to establish (without mailing to it) that a given
IL name is actually valid.  Since you can't reach the host
except through mail anyway, it isn't clear this is a serious
concern.  Is it better to have "user%site@IL" (verifiable) or
"user@site.IL" (unverifiable)?

    We'd be interesting in hearing views on both sides of the issue.
