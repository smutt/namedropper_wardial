	Dave Alpern pointed out the issue of multinationals.  (Of course, he
	is with IBM.)  That is an interesting issue.  It did come up when the
	domain system was designed.

I guess I should mention how this is handled in MHS.  (X.400 ignores it but
the directory system Feb 85 draft mentions it.)

Basically they say that an international organization (they use CCITT
as an example) has to have a unique organization name (I can't remember
if it's unique among international orgs or in the whole world) , and
you just leave off the country to indicate that it's international.
(MHS attributes are unordered, unlike the ordered ARPA domains.)  It's
sort of like saying that if "FOO.DEC.US" exists and DEC goes
international, you start sending to "FOO.DEC." (of course, the syntax
is different.)

In my opinion, what they are basically doing is creating a new country
(call it a "top level domain" if you prefer) for international orgs.
They call the country "", but I would prefer to see it called
"INTERNATIONAL" or just "I" for short.  Thus "FOO.DEC.I".  My
preference is based on clarity and more robust error handling.  (I
would hate to see all the mail where the sender forgot to name the
country being forwarded to the international handler!)

&gt;From a user interface viewpoint, it would be nice for these
organizations to also appear in the domains for the various countries
they are in.  However, this does violate the "only one name" principle,
although this doesn't seem like an overriding concern.
