	The Host Requirements Working Group did not feel secure enough about
	this mechanism to actually require it (nobody really likes to be
	dependent upon configuration data, that network administrators have to
	set and may set wrong), but hoped that implementors will take the
	suggestion seriously, since there is no apparent alternative.

This is a danger developers live in constant fear of.  Still, my
experience has been that administrators frequently don't configure
something at all (if defaults exist) or configure it in the most
plain-vanilla/out-of-the-box fashion possible.  It is rare that one
actually tries his hand at it and mucks it up badly.  This being
the case, if such a mechanism existed, and was not configured, then
it would do exactly what is the case now:  nothing -- just return
the addresses as the come in from the servers.  On the other hand,
competent administrators (and those that began this discussion I
would certainly consider competent, if mis-directed) should be able
to figure out which networks are expensive and which aren't.

At the worst, a standard tool could be devised for figuring out
administrative metrics based on (1) reliability (2) hop-counts
(3) delay (4) bandwidth (5) total utilization, etc. to assist in
this configuration.

But we seem to be sliding off the name service track, and I am not
on the host configuration working group...

P.S.	My initial statement holds true for most examples, with
	sendmail being the exception that proves the rule (comme
	on dit en francais)...
