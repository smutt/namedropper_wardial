Given this flurry of mail, and my recent role as the MAILB wet blanket
("don't use MAILB queries lest your mailer keel over"), I thought it
might be time for me to re-read RFC882/883.  I did, and concluded that
MAILB queries will have to be redone, based in part on what we did
with MX.  I present the ideas here to get some good debate started.

To paraphrase a lot, the basic idea is that you do a MAILB query on
a domain name which combines the username and the domain name, e.g.
craig@bbn.com -&gt; craig.bbn.com.  To quote from page 54 of RFC883, there
are several possible replies to such a query:

    1.  no such domain -- the entry doesn't exist.  In our example,
    proceed on to an MX lookup of bbn.com.

    2.  The query returns an MR (mail rename) RR.  The mailbox name
    is an alias, for example craig.bbn.com rewrites to craig.sh.cs.net
    (craig@sh.cs.net).  Replace old name with new one and try again.
    (Note we need MR RR's because we may also have a host with the
    name of craig.bbn.com, and need to distinguish mailbox aliases
    from CNAME aliases for hosts).

    3.  The query can return an MB RR.  The MB RR is defined as
    containing a host name in the data section, and you are to
    mail the message to this host.

    *I think this may be broken.  Certainly, we've taken the view
    with MX RRs that you should be able to specify an ordered list
    of destinations for a piece of mail.  And I think we should
    do the same with mailboxes.  For example, craig@bbn.com is
    a valid address on almost all BBN machines, and will be forwarded
    on to the proper final destination.  I should be able to say
    that mail to craig.bbn.com should be delivered to any one of
    a dozen hosts.  Also, there's some ambiguity, now that MX's
    exist about whether the right hand side should have an MX
    lookup done on it -- the answer is that it shouldn't for the
    same reason that recursive MX lookups (i.e. looking up the
    MX of the MX) are forbidden.  Just because host A asserts that
    it accepts mail for host B, does not mean that host C, which
    accepts mail for A, should have to accept mail for B.*

    4.  The query can return one or more MG RRs, which means the
    mailbox was actually a mailing list.  Each MG contains a
    mailbox on the right hand side.

    *The specification doesn't say if the right hand side should then
    be subjected to an MAILB query, although, I believe under the
    current definition it must be.  This raises the daunting question
    of whether the mailboxes in an MG can themselves be MGs.  I
    think they can -- and that's almost certainly the wrong way
    to do things.  It means that a mail exploder will end up
    sucking a good part of mailing list across the network for expansion,
    when we have reason to believe that it is more efficient to send
    the mail to the list rather than the list to the piece of mail.
    But I'm not sure MG RRs work unless we allow the expansion of
    the right hand side.  (What good is a mailbox you can't lookup?).*

    5.  The query returns MGs plus one MB.  The mailbox is
    a list, and you can either expand yourself (using MG) or send
    to the MB, which will handle the expansion for you.

    *Note than in some cases you'll get a partial answer.  If you
    keep the MG or MBs your cache, and the cache times for the MG
    and MB RR's are different, either because the originating host
    gave them different TTLs or because you queried for them
    separately, it is possible to get either the MGs or the MB
    instead of both.  In neither case is this fatal, just a
    nuisance.*

So the fun question is how to fix this problem, given that people seem
to want some sort of mailbox binding...
