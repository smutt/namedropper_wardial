Short form answer: use IN-ADDR.

The problem with inverse queries is that they are not guaranteed to be
complete.  That is, you can ask a server if it knows what host has a
certain address, but if it doesn't, you don't get any guidance to a
server which would know.

The IN-ADDR domain was designed to solve this problem.  The idea is that
given an IP address, you can find the host it belongs to.  Note that
since all you typically have is the IP address, the search must be
driven by the address alone; hence there is no separate IN-ADDR.COM or
IN-ADDR.EDU, etc.  The IN-ADDR name is composed of the IP address and a
single, "magic", well-known place to start, which happens to be
IN-ADDR.ARPA.  This choice got made, for good or bad, because we were
accused of snobbery when IN-ADDR was a top level domain.  We might
someday build a similar structure for telephone numbers, or whatever.

Given the reversed octet structure, IN-ADDR subdomains can be delegated
a network at a time.  Now this can be a problem for gateways and hosts
with multiple addresses; it may be that the appropriate sections of
IN-ADDR are in different zones.  For example, suppose the NIC reserves
the ARPANET section of IN-ADDR (e.g. 10.in-addr.arpa), while it
delegates net 8 (e.g. 8.IN-ADDR.ARPA) to BBN's servers.  In this case, a
host which had both a net 10 and a net 8 address would have to get the
NIC to enter the appropriate data under 10.in-addr.arpa, and would have
to get BBN to enter the 8.IN-addr.arpa data.
