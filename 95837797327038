&gt; 	Both problems still occur if you have a stripped down local resolver process.
&gt; 	The second problem also occurs even if you have the resolver linked into
&gt; 	If you use UDP to make queries, you can't distinguish between:
&gt; 		1) name server is dead
&gt; 		2) query packet or response packet was lost
&gt; 		3) name server is taking a long time to find the answer
&gt; 	
&gt; Ah, this is the crux of the matter!  It is that the transport protocol
&gt; is insufficient to tell whether the query has been received and is
&gt; being acted on or not.  What is really needed is a transaction-oriented
&gt; protocol like the Birnell RPC, or like VMTP.  This would let you know
&gt; if 1) or 2) happened, but would fail in the case of the server crashing
&gt; having just sent an acknowledgement of receiving your data (of course,
&gt; any protocol will have Byzantine weaknesses).

I am not familiar at al with Birnell RPC, and have only heard a little
about VMTP.  Probably VMTP encapsulation of the present DNS protocol
would be the simplest.  It is probably only worth using this for
recursive queries.

&gt; We can also get multicasting as a freebie, and send queries to all
&gt; nameservers, maybe using expanding circles...

Better be careful with this.  Rumor has it that DNS is a fairly
significant portion of the Internet traffic (but it probably would be
a lot less if all the broken implementations/configurations were fixed).
