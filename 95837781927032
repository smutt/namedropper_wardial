	Your definition of sites is fine -- it is analogous to what mine is.
    (Apparently I wasn't clear in the past).

	The problem is that even at the fine-grained level you describe,
    *sites are not always completely networked internally*.  In other
    words, there are sites where different machines within a single
    logical site get their mail and connectivity from different networks,
    and those machines do not communicate internally.  (I can tell a story
    about one such site where the administrators of the BITNET and CSNET
    hosts meet once a week to exchange tapes of their mail).

	You cannot assume that by finding out what site a machine is in,
    that you know how to deliver to it.

I could take the easy way out and claim that if they can't talk to each
other, they should be in different sites.  That may even be the answer.

Another possible answer is that there is another entity, different from
sites, which describes mail connectivity.  Now we're back to MX records
again, but this time we would have an entity that means something,
instead of a name with data attached.

Another possibility I just thought of, and this might be even closer, is
that knowing a site IS enough to know how to deliver mail to it.  The
site could describe, for outsider's purposes, a set of mail forwarding
hosts.  Senders would choose a host based on connectivity and other
criteria.  Inside the site, if there are breaks in connectivity, the
local mail systems cooperate to shuffle mail back and forth, e.g., with
tapes.  The way this might show up in the naming database is that in
addition to hosts having a site, they have a host-mail-group indicator.
The outside world needn't know about this.  The naming system should be
able to allow and express this information, but it isn't really
necessary for the entire world to know the 15 thousand peculiarities of
mail delivery that exist.
