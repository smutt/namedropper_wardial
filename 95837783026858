     Excuse me for the length of this message.

     I recently had to go through some of this myself, so I'll share my
experiences with you.  I see this through two viewpoints.  In the first, I am
the mailsystems developer for SUMEX-AIM, coordinating a project with
implementations on Unix, TOPS-20, Xerox Lisp machine, TI Lisp Machine, and
Macintosh.  In the second viewpoint, I'm the owner of a DEC-20 system and
administrator of a domain (with two operational hosts at present) that is
accessible only via MX access.

     SUMEX-AIM is one of a handful of DEC-20 systems which fully implements
domains including MX records (the others are XX.LCS.MIT.EDU, C.CS.CMU.EDU,
PANDA.PANDA.COM, and I believe KL.SRI.COM).  Other DEC-20 systems use the
%-routing hack, and there is an elaborate mechanism to try to make it
transparent and transmogrify the addresses appropriately, etc.

     My experience on SUMEX-AIM was that we were able to totally drop use of
the %-routing hack mechanisms.  It's possible that some mailing lists still
use it explicitly, but, in general, we tell our users simply to use the domain
form of the host name.  The problems we faced, such as they were, were mostly
those traumas in going from host table to domains.  Many of those traumas were
avoided because I avoided halfway measures; I migrated from a full host table
implementation to a full domain implementation.  What's more, I had delayed
the migration until all the technical issues had been solved.  This included
rewriting algorithms to do things the "domain way" instead of merely
converting host table algorithms to their domain equivalents.  As a specific
example, I use CNAME information instead of number_to_name(name_to_number(X))
to get the canonical form of host X.

     The situation on PANDA.PANDA.COM was somewhat different.  The PANDA.COM
domain is accessible only via MX access, and for a long time its mail to the
outside world used the %-routing hack.  I was somewhat nervous in turning off
the hack, but my observation was that most of the hosts PANDA exchanged mail
with were MX-capable.  The hosts which were not were mostly TOPS-20's running
either host table or the old ISI domain software (not MX-capable), and among
those PANDA was well-known.  So, I took the plunge and migrate.  It was a
major performance win to nuke the %-routing tables (PANDA is a slow machine)!

     Indeed, the TOPS-20's PANDA talked to adapted; they either added PANDA to
their %-routing tables or used some other Internet address to mail to me.  The
major problem seems to have happened on certain MX-capable hosts in the
backwaters of the net.  Apparently there is some condition where certain
domain servers falsely return authoritative information that a particular host
or domain does not exist rather than the indeterminate indication.  I have
noticed that on SUMEX on rare instances where suddenly a well-known host is
suddenly labelled as non-existant.  These episodes haven't been happening much
lately; apparently the buggy servers are being identified and stomped.  But,
in the backwaters, I have occasionally gotten messages from some of my
contacts on MX-capable Unix systems which find that "mail to PANDA.PANDA.COM
isn't working today" because some machine in the middle of the mail path
rejects that host name.

     In general, however, I think that the overall amount of problems has been
considerably *less* than before, and furthermore I have had fewer problems
that I did in the past with hosts which mishandled %-routing.  There seem to
be many hosts out there that try to be clever with %-routings (in violation of
RFC 822) and blow it.  My overall experience is that mail works *better* with
domains than before.  I'm glad to see that we've finally gotten to that point.

     My advice for a site considering whether or not to go all the way with
domains is -- Go For It!
