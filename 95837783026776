For various reasons, I had reason to poke around the domain database for
think.com, specifically the names Think.COM and Zarathustra.Think.COM.
What I found is probably not in line with the intent of the domain
system, though it may be technically legal.

There are two servers for Think.COM: Think.COM itself and CCA.CCA.COM.
That's OK.

Each server when asked various questions about Think.COM and
Zarathustra.Think.COM gives the same answer, except for asking for the
Start of Authority for Think.COM.  Think.COM has a serial number of 158
but CCA has a serial number of 157.  This update may have been rather
recent and indeed I wasn't able to get a connection to Think.COM for a
few days.

When asked about the canonical name for Zarathustra.Think.COM, each
authoritatively says there is none.  This would be OK except for the
following.

When asked for the Internet address(es) of Zarathustra.Think.COM, each
gives three addresses:
	192.5.104.218,
	10.4.0.6, and
	192.31.179.26
When asked for the Internet address(es) of Think.COM, each gives two
addresses:
	10.4.0.6, and
	192.5.104.218
These are the same as the first two addresses of Zarathustra.Think.COM.
This would lead just about anybody to believe these are really the same
host.  Then why isn't there a canonical name record?  And why do the two
different versions of the host not have the same set of addresses?

The other inconsistency, and this is probably just a spazz, is that the
RNAME of the SOA record specifies PostMaster.Think.COM.Think.COM.  There
is no MB record for this name (CCA gives RCODE=NAME-ERROR).  It probably
wants to be just PostMaster.Think.COM, and thus I've addressed this note
to PostMaster@Think.COM, and for grins also addressed it to
PostMaster.Think.COM@Think.COM and PostMaster@Think.COM.Think.COM.
