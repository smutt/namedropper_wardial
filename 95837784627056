&gt;   If you complain about the operation of the table, make sure to
&gt;   suggest something better.
&gt;
&gt;I'd suggest ucbarpa.berkeley.edu:pub/4.3/bind.4.8.tar.Z.  If you're
&gt;running an operating system to which you can't manage to port a
&gt;resolver, persuade the company that sold the system to you to do one
&gt;for you.  Beat them over their collective heads with RFC1123 sections
&gt;5.3.5 and 6.1.1 until they succumb.  That's why it was written.
&gt;
&gt;Really, this is a noble goal, but misdirected.  Better to spend the
&gt;programmer and administrator time, disk space, and net bandwidth
&gt;implementing a resolver.

I beg to disagree; while a static host table has all the defects you
mention (and they are serious defects), some of us

 1) run systems which have been abandoned by the manufacturer
    and will never, never be upgraded but can't be thrown out
   or
 2) aren't directly on the internet, but still need internet addresses
    (because we are NEAR an internet host but can't access it in real
    time)
   or
 3) are on the internet but for political/monetary/practical reasons,
    name servers are effectively unusable/inaccessable for long periods
    (beating on people won't help; they don't and won't care)
   or
 4) want to search the host name table for near matches (I forgot his
    address!  What's likely?)

There are more reasons, but these are the ones that apply personally.
Do you have any suggestions for us?
