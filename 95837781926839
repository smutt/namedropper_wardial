There certainly are two problems here. I am not sure which one Steve
was asking about in the original message, but my problem CANNOT be
solved merely by caching failures.

Let me reiterate an example (sorry if this is repetitious):

Many sites are like us, with one gateway (in the ISO sense, not
necessarily in the IP sense) to the Arpanet, and a large private
internet behind the gateway. At least DEC and Xerox are like this, for
example.  We would like to have all mail for any host in the domain
Sun.COM relayed from the Arpanet through the gateway machine.  I
thought that putting a single wildcard MX record for *.Sun.COM into our
database would do it.  This did work in an early version of BIND, but
does NOT WORK in the current version.  The problem is that when you do
an address lookup for a host that does not have any address records,
BIND finds the the wildcard, even though it has the wrong type, and
returns an empty NOERROR response instead of NXDOMAIN.  Sendmail treats
this as a soft error and requeues the message for later transmission.
This continues forever, until the queue timeout expires.

If this is truly a "feature", then it means that wildcard records can
NEVER EVER be used for domains that are even losely connected to the
Internet.  (Unless you don't care that mail to non-existant names
sticks in the queue for a week.) Wildcards should only be used for domains
such as the UUCP zone, that are not connected.  This needs to be made
very clear in our installation and administration documents.
