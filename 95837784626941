A question has arisen (in comp.mail.sendmail) which has by now left
behind questions of what sendmail does in certain situations and is
instead a larger issue of what to do about MX'ing hosts.

The situation: I write mail to, e.g., user@domain.edu.  There exists a
single MX RR which stipulates that the MX host is forwarding.host.edu.
My mailer then calmly passes this mail to that MX'ing host, expecting
that the mail will be handled by forwarding.host.edu on its own.

The problem is that forwarding.host.edu may fulfill its MX'ing service
by generating a UUCP !-path route by which to get to domain.edu, and
the potential exists for that route to pass back through my machine,
with the FQDN as part of the path.  My mailer configuration (I happen
to use sendmail, but the problem is not [I believe] necessarily
specific to sendmail) takes any multi-hop !-path address and strips it
to the rightmost domain spec, on the justification that a domain spec
is an absolute address, and any preceding path information is
unnecessary and superfluous.  That is, host1!host2!domain.edu!user is
stripped to domain.edu!user and then converted to @-format as
user@domain.edu.

Naturally, this has just closed a mail loop, as my sendmail will now
once again discover that the MX host is forwarding.host.edu, send it
there, which will again generate the long !-path passing through my
machine again, ad nauseum until a hopcount limit is reached and the
mail is bounced back as undeliverable.

I've been reading RFCs most of the day since this came up, trying to
find an authoritative comment on how MX'ing hosts are supposed to
perform their service.  974 and 103[345] stipulate a lot about how
hosts which are *sending* mail must do things in RR preference order
and so forth, but don't say much about what the receiving MX host
should do once it has control of such a piece of mail, other than that
it must not deliver to any host with a preference higher/worse than
its own.

Since the problem was first discussed, I find that the specific
example in question is fidonet.org, which has a single MX RR aimed at
handies.ucar.edu; Handies then does some local stuff to figure out
which of several FIDONet gateways to use based on the specific FIDONet
host stipulated, and so generates a !-path which may pass through
hosts that want to do MX things about fidonet.org, and these paths
themselves contain the domain name fidonet.org.  (Greg, please correct
me if I've misstated the situation.)

The longer I think about this, the less I like MX hosts generating
long delivery paths (not necessarily UUCP !-paths) which pass through
hosts not under the control of the same adminstrator as the MX host
itself.  Any such paths depend on the behavior of the intermediate
sites, which is unknown and unpredictable.  I'm very much inclined to
say that any forwarding.host.edu must speak directly to the intended
domain.edu in order to be a valid MX host.  "Speaking directly" may
itself be somewhat indirect; if the administrator of
forwarding.host.edu is also the person who manages the mailer and
network configuration of host1 and host2, then a delivery path of
host1!host2!domain.edu!user is still "speaking directly" and hence
valid.

I guess where I think the situation has really broken down is that it
ought to be the responsibility of the mangers of the intended
destination (fidonet.org, in this case) to provide more complete MX
support in the DNS; that is, there should be MX hosts on a regional
basis, via the subdomain definitions of fidonet.org.  The MX hosts
should not be taking chances with what might happen on machines
outside their sphere of influence.

Can someone with more experience in this sort of situation shed any
light?  Is there a right and wrong here, or are the RFCs too fuzzy to
say which is The Way It Should Be?

Confused,
