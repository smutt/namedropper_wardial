Well, I disagree with you on whether mailers should follow forwarding
paths for you (I'm for it) but I think this is getting into the area
of religion.  I would comment, though, that when I see 50% of the mail
in my retransmission queue being from somebody in California to
somebodyelse in California because of forwarding trails, I tend to
want a fix.

But in the case of the distributed mailsystem approach, there is a
major benefit to doing it via domains.  I do indeed have LCS.MIT.EDU
as a nickname for a machine (XX), but what if that machine is down for
several days due to serious hardware failure?  Happens to any machine
one or two times a year (freqency proportional to the number of people
depending on the machine to be up, of course.)  If the only support
for "user@lcs.mit.edu" is via XX, I'm screwed.  If it's in the domain
system, things still work except for people who actually read their
mail on XX, and even there there's hope because those people can
temporarily route their mail somewhere else.

Also, if you carry the idea of having a central mail node per site to
its logical conclusion you get a machine like MC.LCS.MIT.EDU, which is
used exclusively for mail (no CPU time to spare for anything else).
Would you believe a dedicated mail machine that manages to get into
the BBN top-ten traffic list every few weeks?  Don't try this at home
unless you have a spare mainframe or two sitting idle....

I agree that nobody really understands what the impact of queries
flying everywhere will be.  Needs research, but needs to be
implemented before anybody can do traffic analysis.

Note that much of the overhead problem with domain queries in general
can be aleviated by making extensive use of zone transfers at off
hours.  I suspect that it would be a lot less overhead if all the big
mail sites kept a local copy of the root zone to avoid having to query
all the .ARPA names, etc.  The root servers can of course tune their
parameters (SOA fields, when they give a REFUSED reply to an AXFR
request, etc) to keep the loading tolerable.
