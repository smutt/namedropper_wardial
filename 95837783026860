The real issues here are whether or not we want to pursue the ideal
behind domain names and MX mail addressing, and whether its reasonable
to make some administrative rules which will tend to further that goal.

Loosely stated, the ideal is that all addresses take the form
local-part@domain such that:

	local-part is indeed a local part, and not a route, and doesn't
	contain operators which have non-local significance.

	domain is a single or MIRVed set of MX.  Implicit
	in this is that the mail exchange may convert between the
	Internet (822, domain, SMTP) style and whatever is on the
	other side, or that such conversion may not be necessary for all
	or these aspects (e.g. domain names but no SMTP).

	domains are organizationally structured and don't include implicit
	semantics such as network identification, etc.

The advantages are (1) simpler mail addresses (2) more intelligent and
robust mail routing.  For example, if there are two mail gateways to
FOONET, an 100 FOONET hosts, we might set up 200 MX entries (two per
FOONET host) with the closer gateway given preference in each case.  Of
course, there is the issue about "closer" according to whom, but let's
assume that FOONET is either much stronger or weaker, and the choice is
clear.

While there is a lot of legitimate argument about the merits of the
ideal, one thing seems clear to me.  The worst possible world is one
where there is a lot of duplication of function, and the duplicate
functions interact in strange ways.  That's where we are now.  Sure,
this is an Internet-centric view of the world, and we can't pry %s and
!s from cold dead fingers, but the mail list restrictions seem to me to
be the most reasonable and effective way of furthering the MX ideal for
the internet.  (I'd happily make exceptions for % and ! in local
part which aren't parts of routes.)

I'd also note that the dot-delimited style of the domain system seems to
be popular outside of the IP/TCP world, and maybe the Internet should
compromise a bit on its naming ideals for interoperability's sake.

P.S. Many have sent me private messages objecting to the choice of BIND
and NAMEDROPPERS mailing lists as starting points, since this cuts off
precisely the help which is necessary to aid conversion.  I sympathize,
but believe a stronger principle is that you should not push something
you wouldn't use yourself.
