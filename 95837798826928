    Well, I used to administer one of those disjoint subnets, and DNS
service was a mere nicety.  If I seriously wished to do mail with the rest
of the world, I could do so... but had little need to.
    It should be noted that, while common, most of these disjoint subnets
don't have a need for DNS service, because they communicate via
``traditional'' methods.  Ie, their users write down addresses, keep
phonebooks, use uucp pathalias, etc. If they communicate at all (:-)).

    If I was faced with making one such subnet communicate, I'd do so by
indirection [Note: I'm faced with making four such subnets communicate in
the coming academic year!].  Given a local DNS, I'd teach it the Internet
way of contacting the intermediary (x25 gateway, trusted workstation, tape
drive, etc).  I'd teach the intermediary the rest.
    This requires a mailer that will will wait for arbitrarily long times
for the DNS to get ``primed'' with the information it needs to construct a
valid address, and could absolutely roadblock an ill-advised user agent that
tried to use DNS queries to help its user (:-)).
    Fortunatly, I have such a mailer(MTA) and a non-helpfull user agent.

    Alas, I don't see the relevance of RFC 987 mappings to this problem.
If I was gatewaying into another world and not just using it as transport...
Has this discussion drifted?
