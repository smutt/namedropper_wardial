This issue has come up several times, and I would suggest that we are
really talking about three issues: is RR ordering a good thing inside
the domain system, where should the ordering occur, and what should we
do about the specific problem of addresses.

1. The domain system does not guarantee to preserve the order of RRs.

A pragmatic argument is that I have seen servers which don't preserve order.

The primary argument here is that there is no good place within the
domain system components to decide the order.  For example, the only
reasonable place to order addresses is at the site of their use, so that
neither source name server or destination name server (remember it might
be a recursive server for a large community) is appropriate.  Where
ordering is important, it can be done by ranking information in the RRs,
as is done in MX.

A secondary concern is that we might be painting ourselves into a corner
for future domain system development with regard to dynamic update of
domain data, etc.  For example, we might have a future set of domain
transactions of the flavor of "add the following RR at the specified
name".  If order becomes important, then we will have to support it,
which will complicate things for no great benefit.

2. Specific interfaces to the domain system can process the information
   they pass on to the client, but the general interface shouldn't.  An
   exception might be that the general interface might sort things to be
   some quasi-"alphabetical" order, so that RRs of the same type are
   together, and RRs within a type are sorted by domain names, etc.

A rough version of this takes place in the current version of JEEVES.
The flavor of JSYS which can ask for all RRs associated with a specific
name which match a QTYPE doesn't worry about order; the flavor of JSYS
which asks for a single address for a specific host picks the best
address out of the choices available.

3. The benefits of sorting addresses are obvious for anyone who has ever
   accessed the NIC by the "wrong address", so we should provide an
   interface which sorts addresses.

Most of the benefits of sorting can be achieved via a small amount of
configuration information.  For example, the configuration information
might say "directly connected networks best, net 10 second best, net 26
third, then class A, class B, and last class C".  (Note that this is just an
example, your milage may vary.)

Another issue we might want in this is supplying a RTT estimate along
with the sorted addresses.  Of course this gets muddy too, since which RTT
are we talking about?  For example, ICMP PING times are bad for use with
domain retransmissions since they often don't include the process schedule,
paging, etc times associated with a domain query.

A general concern I have is that we don't base design decisions on bad
examples or hacks.  I get real uncomfortable when I think about deciding
to preserve RR order so that the "one-way" address of some UCL host
works.  While it may be that it's important to accommodate this or
similar constructs, the information should be explicit.
