Since the BIND mailing list appears to be aliased to /dev/null
these days, I'm submitting my bug list to this news group in
order to get the word out.

The following is the list of bugs and deficiencies I know about
in BIND 4.8.2 (they are also present in 4.8.1).

* Zone transfers include A records for all name servers referenced in the
  zone file.  Only those A records necessary as glue information should
  be included.

* If a name server is authoritative for a zone and a subzone, zone
  transfers of the top zone incorrectly include all resource records
  for the top domain of the subzone, not just the NS records.

* Assume host A is the primary name server for Y.Z and secondary name
  server for X.Y.Z, and B is is the primary name server for X.Y.Z and
  secondary for Y.Z, and host C is secondary for both.  If host D is
  substituted for host C as the third name server for both zones by
  editing the appropriate primary zone files and signalling A and B to
  reload these zone files, A and B will believe that C is still a
  name server because it is still listed in the secondary backup files.
  Zone transfers of these zones between A and B will include A, B, C,
  and D as the name servers.

* If an NS record refers to a non-existent host, BIND will repeatedly
  query to find the address of the host.  This is a serious problem
  when BIND thinks this is a root name server because its cache
  has been polluted (GENTER-ADAM.AF.MIL).

* If an NS record refers to hosts alias (the name listed by the NS
  only has a CNAME record), BIND will notice that it does not have
  an A record for this host and will repeatedly query for it.  This
  is a serious problem when BIND thinks this is a root name server
  because its cache has been polluted
  (SRI-NIC.ARPA  IN CNAME NIC.DDN.MIL).

* The RFC's state that when a resolver starts a secondary query to
  find the address of a name server, the maximum number of queries
  should be set to less than the number of queries remaining for the
  primary query.  BIND does not implement this.

* The RFC's state that resource records from a response should not
  be mixed with those in the cache.  Either the cached records
  should be retained or they should be replaced with those in the
  response.  When BIND first starts, it queries the root name servers
  for a list of the root name servers, and hopefully gets an
  authoritative answer.  If at a later time BIND receives a list
  of the root name servers in the authority/additional sections
  of a response to some random query, it combines these with what
  is in the cache.

* The RFC's state that if a resolver receives a bogus answer from
  a name server, it should be removed from the SLIST.  If BIND
  receives a bogus delegation from a name server, it does not
  do this.  If the remote name server has multiple addresses,
  BIND will query the rest of them.

* If BIND receives multiple identical recursive queries from the
  same host address and port number, and with the same ID, it
  will suppress the duplicates and only perform one set of queries
  on the appropriate remote name servers.  If multiple clients on
  several hosts or using different port numbers simultaneously
  make the same query, BIND will start multiple sets of queries
  to the remote name servers.  To reduce DNS traffic on the
  internet, BIND should coalesce these queries.  Caching
  temporary failure should also be considered.

* If BIND is misconfigured to forward queries to itself, it
  gets very confused.  BIND should remove the local host's
  address(es) from the list of forwarders and log the error.

* If a primary zone file is updated, BIND is signalled to reload
  the zone file, and BIND reloads the zone file and detects an
  error which causes it to mark the zone invalid, then an SOA
  query for this zone in preparation for a zone transfer will
  cause BIND to core dump.
