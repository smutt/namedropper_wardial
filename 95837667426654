Here's a problem that I can't figure out reading anything, that I
thought someone might have anything to say.

I want to set the name servers for the 52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain to be
say, PREP.AI.MIT.EDU, HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU, and GUTENBERG.AI.MIT.EDU.
MKL@SRI-NIC won't do it, because he says that then NIC would have to
know about the AI.MIT.EDU domain. Instead, he wants to set the servers
to the 52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain to be the same as those for the
MIT.EDU domain, and then those servers should delegate further to the
servers I wanted. This sounds like the wrong thing, because I'm not
about to give up without a fight authority over the IN-ADDR domain
corresponding to the network number assigned to the MIT AI lab to an
entity that is not the MIT AI lab.

Does NIC have to know about some domain, for example AI.MIT.EDU, in
order to say that the servers for some IN-ADDR.ARPA subdomain, like
PREP.AI.MIT.EDU? If yes, then isn't this a bad thing? Doesn't this force
the delegation of authority over the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain to follow the
delegation of authority over the domain in which the server machines are
named?

    OK, I was a bit confused.  I think you are too.  Here is what
    I think should be happening, and I think our IN-ADDR file
    is correct at this time.  MIT.EDU has authority over your domain
    AI.MIT.EDU.  Therefor MIT.EDU is required to know about the
    servers for AI.MIT.EDU, we are not.  In our INADDR file we
    currently have a pointer stating that for queries of net
    128.52 you should go ask the MIT.EDU servers.  Those servers
    should then tell the querier to go ask the AI.MIT.EDU servers.

    I.E. If I ask the nic for info on 1.2.52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA,
    it gives me the names of the MIT.EDU servers.  I would
    then query them, and they would give me the names of
    the AI servers.  

    I think you should send your in-addr requests off to the
    MIT.EDU domain maintainer then...
