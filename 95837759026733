&gt; From: mark@cbpavo.cbosgd.ATT.COM (Mark Horton)
&gt; Subject: medical community

&gt; We are finding ourselves in a position where we have to establish a
&gt; domain naming convention for the medical community....
&gt; One possibility would be to put some of them in EDU and some in COM
&gt; and some in GOV, depending on whether it's a university hospital, a
&gt; private hospital, or the VA.  ...Another
&gt; possibility is to put them under a new top level domain called MED.
&gt; Yet another is to put them under a single subdomain somewhere else
&gt; in the domain tree, perhaps MED.ORG, for example.

I don't think you want to fragment the medical community by splitting it up
among the existing top level domains.  These domains came into being mostly
because the EXISTING Internet sites could be (relatively) easily split up
this way.  Massive net additions, especially a bunch of medical sites being
dumped onto the net, are going to require new, original thinking.  Just
parroting the ARPA line isn't going to cut it...

If I understand it correctly, the goal is to have a branch factor of about
50 to 100 at each node in the tree.  If so, what WE have done in the EDU
community might not have been the right thing.  Say there are 50 states,
nearly each has a state university, some have two.  That's your 50 to 100
right there, not even counting private universities or high school systems.

BUT, UMD has many geographically separated campuses (heck, I just found out
about the Diego Garcia campus last week!).  Suppose they each wanted their
own domain?  UMBC.EDU (Baltimore Campus), UMES.EDU (Eastern Shore), etc.

So far we're holding the line by giving out names like UMBC1.UMD.EDU but we
were also forced to grant a CS.UMD.EDU to the Computer Science Department
and an EE.UMD.EDU to Engineering.  The same pressures happen in the other
root level domains, and I am deathly afraid of someday seeing a site name
like Ralph-Spoil-Sport-Motors.COM pop up...

Certainly there are more than 100 organizations worthy of the namespace.

Had you thought about the existing organizations?  AMA.ORG?  If there is a
national hospital association this might be the appropriate oranization to
organize a namespace...  I would guess there is one for "not-for-profit"
hospitals and another for "for-profit" ones, but then we are back to the
split-up-among-COM-MIL-ORG non-solution again.

I think questions of balance between the branch factor at the root and at
ORG should be addressed here.  I also think a study should be made to think
out just how the higher levels of an Internet should be organized.
Unfortunately, I do not control ARPA money.  If I did, I think this kind of
study should be a high-priority item.

A secondary question is how to organize the domain internally.  Your proposed
approach of CPMC.something is probably the best solution to THIS contract
THIS year.  Is it the best solution in the long run?  You guys used to think
in the long term back when you were the best phone company in the world...

Do you want to organize it by specialty?  pathology.MED, surgery.MED, etc?
By state?  What about multi-state organizations?  How is the AMA structured?
How are the existing hospital organizations structured?

Summary:  don't try to design in a vacuum, and don't insist on reinventing
the wheel.  Find out how the medical community is presently organized, both
on a personal and organizational level.  To the extent that these patterns
satisfy people's needs, implement them.

&gt; ...we're looking
&gt; for a niche for the whole community, although we can't force anybody
&gt; to register in a name space that we would be administering....

Don't worry about this.  To a certain extent the domains are going to evolve
in a Darwinian manner.  If a domain is managed in a careless or slovenly way,
the marginal benefit of membership will not exceed the marginal cost, and it
will become attractive for that member to establish membership in a competing
(and perhaps better-managed) domain.  If what you design is good and useful,
people will WANT to register.  (MY long distance company *is* ATT.)

&gt; This all becomes more complex when X.400 is taken into account, since
&gt; we must plan for the possibility that some day OSI will become dominant,
&gt; and then we will have little choice but to convert to it.  It would be
&gt; nice to have a naming convention that fits in reasonably will [sic] with
&gt; the X.400 global naming tree.

It would also be nice for the X.400 standards to be a bit more widely
circulated.  We are having an (ahem) "discussion" on this very topic
on the MAIL-L@BITNIC.BITNET mailing list right now, re: the
Internet free-document policy vs. ISO copyrighting.

--------------------

These are just the mutterings of a slightly-burntout-computer-freak.  Treat
them as 98% dross and 2% gold (if that much).  Is discussion of this topic
taking place elsewhere, or has everybody else also decided to think before
they speak?  :-)
