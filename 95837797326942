   I'm not sure what I'm asking, so I didn't know how to phrase the subject. :-)
   But, I'm interested to know if a USENET site could handle the routing for
   other USENET sites.  Example:  Let's say my site has a registered domain
   and I have a site that I connect to that is on Internet and is my MX
   forwarder.  I also have 10 other sites that _want their own domain_ instead
   of hiding behind mine.  Now, here's the question.  Is there a way that these
   ten sites (after registering, of course) can list my domain name as their
   MX forwarder?  In other words, is there a way that they don't have to have
   my Internet contact as the MX forwarder for them or do I just not know what
   I'm talking about?  I know that I can have machines use my domain -
   my domain is foobar.com and can have those systems be whatever.foobar.com.
   But that's not what I'd like to do.  Thanx in advance for any ideas...

In a word, no.

To be more specific, the mechanism that provide you with mail forwarding
is the MX record, which has to point to a machine which has
an A record, like so

foobar.com.		MX 10	mailgw.forwarder.org.	;; OK
mailgw.forwarder.org.	A	135.24.64.24		;; needed
blurfl.com.		MX 10	foobar.com.		;; nope
blurfl.com.		MX 10	mailgw.forwarder.org.	;; OK

The first MX record won't work for blurfl.com because the MX record
doesn't point to a real A record.

It is possible to hack your way around this by having whoever
is doing name service for the foobar.com domain put in a false
A record for foobar.com which really is the address of 'mailgw'
in this case, i.e.

foobar.com.		A	135.24.64.24		;; a lie!

This is a bald-faced lie and asks for trouble, especially since things
like 'telnet' and 'ftp' to foobar.com will now work though not as you
might expect.  As an instance of this compare the result when you
connect to "um.cc.umich.edu" and "ummts.cc.umich.edu".

Even so this will not work without cooperation from your friendly mail
gatewaying site, since they have to known (i.e. hard-wire in their
mail configuration) that "blurfl.com" should be delivered to
"foobar.com" via uucp or avian carrier or what have you, not in the
standard way of trusting the domain name system to resolve an address.
It would also be un-sociable to put this extra forwarding burden on
your mail relay without giving them the courtesy of rejecting this
extra load.
