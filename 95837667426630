We all know (or should know) how easy it is to break into a Berkeley
style system that relies on IP source addresses for authentication.
(To break into system A, wait for system B, which A trusts, to go down.
Then change your local host name to B, reboot, and impersonate B.
This only requires a Sun workstation or similar PC which you control
and which is tapped into the local Ethernet.)

In fact, Berkeley warns people about the problem in the documentation
and discourages you from putting many hosts in the list of trusted
hosts.  They also do not distribute any programs that let you go super
user without a password.  And they prevent root on one machine from
becoming root on another trusted machine.

But in the interests of productivity, a lot of sites configure their
systems to be wide open (or at least they use the hooks as provided
so their local machines all trust each other.)  That way they don't
spend half their life typing passwords across the Ethernet (which
itself would be a security problem if someone is watching the cable.)

So, it's a fact of life that IP source addresses are going to be used
for authentication.  It's not perfect, and it certainly leaves a lot
of places vulnerable to a cable-tapper, but the risks often are
outweighed by the benefits.

So the position "you should not use IP source addresses for host
authentication, therefore there shall be no facility to translate
IP source addresses to host names" isn't helpful.

P.S. Somebody ought to invent a public key cryptosystem to do the
validation without having to type a password and without these sorts
of vulnerabilities.  But in the meantime...
