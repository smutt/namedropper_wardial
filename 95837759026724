The situation is not deteriorating. Trying to force the issue is not beneficial
either since the domain system still needs work. The MX issue only got
resolved in the last year. Address to name translations are still very very
fuzzy.

In other words, we have a new system that came out of developement into
production with lots of problems. SMTP on the other hand was based on FTP
and MTP....It ended up being a very powerful standard used in many differnet
networking enviroments: BITNET, DECNet, Internet, etc.

CMU will be converting this summer. We are still not happy with the domain
system nor are we very happy with the state of the ARPA Internet connectivity
that the domain system depends on. We will implement something in the spirit
of the domain system but takes effective and neccessary steps to avoid
the current specifications and implementation weaknesses.

For the time being, sites not on the internet that value making communication
with internet sites easy should use the user%non-internet-host@internethost
address format. Sites that don't care about that ease of communication
should only use their domain names but relays should insert Received:
lines. CMU is currently handling non-Internet domain names by saying 
the ARPA Internet is in a transition and CMU is lagging behind...it is not
the non-Internet site's problem but ours and we are working on it.
