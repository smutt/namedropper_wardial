NAMEDROPPERS

Scope:

   This NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the 
   concepts, principles, design, and implementation of the domain style 
   names.  The main focus of this group is the review of documents 
   describing domain style name system (currently RFCs 882 and 883) and 
   discussion of the implementation of the system.

   The scope is limited to the technical aspects of the system.  It does
   not include discussion of the actual names selected, or the semantics
   of those names.  There are other forums for those discussions (for 
   example, HEADER-PEOPLE, MSGGROUP, and ARPA-MHS).

Policy:

   While one of the advantages of computer mail and mailing lists 
   mechanisms is fast response, in this list we prefer to go a little 
   slow to ensure thoughtful discussion.  In general, one should let 
   some time go by (a day) between first reading a message and composing
   a response.  Even during periods of intense activity on this list one
   should not send more than one message per day.  Typically this would 
   allow one to discuss several other contributions in one message.

      *  Wait a day between reading and sending.

      *  Send at most one message per day.

   On the other hand, this is a list for participants in a discussion, 
   not observers.  Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from 
   time to time.

      To get on or off NAMEDROPPERS send your request to 
      NAMEDROPPERS-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

Related mailing lists:

   MSGGROUP

      This group is for the discussion of electronic mail issues in 
      general.  This may include the discussion of how best to use an 
      particular name system, or the interaction between different 
      naming systems.

         To get on or off MSGGROUP send your request to 
         MSGGROUP-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA.

   HEADER-PEOPLE

      This group is for the discussion of issues in the design and 
      implementation of the DARPA community Text mail system (currently 
      based on RFCs 821 and 822).  Comments are welcome from any 
      community that uses these conventions.  This may include the 
      interaction of the domain style names with the operation of this 
      mail system.

         To get on or off HEADER-PEOPLE send your request to 
         HEADER-PEOPLE-REQUEST@MIT-MC.ARPA.

   ARPA-MHS

      This group is explicitly focused on the development of means for 
      interoperation and interconnection of the DARPA community Text 
      mail system and the international standards community X.400/MHS 
      mail systems.  This includes developing a mapping between the 
      naming procedures used in these two systems.

         To get on or off ARPA-MHS send your request to 
         ARPA-MHS-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA.

   MMM-PEOPLE

      This group is exploring the issues in multimedia computer mail 
      (i.e., mail that includes text, bitmap, voice, graphics, and other
      special data types).  This is based on work that has gone on for 
      several years under both DARPA and NAVY sponsorship.  There is 
      consideration in this group of the use of X.400/MHS as a basis for
      further work on multimedia mail.

         To get on or off MMM-PEOPLE send your request to 
         MMM-PEOPLE-REQUEST@USC-ISIB.ARPA.

Multiple Addresses:

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS 
   and either of these lists (and certainly not both!).  In fact, people
   are pretty careful about which lists they are and are not on.  It is 
   really best to send your message to exactly one list.  If it was the 
   wrong one, someone will let you know.  Sending a message to more than
   one list will surely waste a significant amount of both computer and 
   people time and resources.

   In fact, when sending to NAMEDROPPERS the only address needed is 
   NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  If you are responding to a particular 
   comment by someone he or she will get the message without being 
   explicitly addressed, and you will get a copy back too.

History:

   All of the previous discussion of the NAMEDROPPERS can be found in 
   the files

      &lt;NAMSER&gt;NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL.* on SRI-NIC.ARPA,

   where * is a wild-card for "1" and "2" (higher numbers will 
   eventually exist).  These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP.  
   New member of NAMEDROPPERS may which to copy and read these archives 
   before joining the discussion.
