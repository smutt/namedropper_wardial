In the last few months, the root servers at ISIC, ISIA, and the NIC have
been receiving an increasing flow of queries asking for the name servers
for the root for all classes.  That is QTYPE=NS, QCLASS=*, QNAME=.
These queries are slightly malformed, in that the response bit is set.
There is no particular pattern just a steady stream (2/second) from a
lot of different hosts.  Since the TOPS-20 domain software separates
queries from responses using different ports, it was not checking for
the response bit, and so answers these queries as if they were correct.
DPK has christened these packets "bogons".

The problem is that these packets are soaking up increasing portions of
the root server cycles and network bandwidth.  Its not an exaggeration
to say that between the three root servers, we are using the majority of
a KL answering bogons.  The root servers are getting several bogons per
second, their output queues are building, telnets are slowing, etc.

DPK claims that bogons come from BIND 4.5, and is trying to drain the
swamp via BIND 4.7, rather than deal with the 4.5 alligator.  The
people who own the root servers want their cycles back.

I'm not a UNIX person. My questions are:

Does anyone understand the cause of bogons?

Does anyone have a quick fix for BIND 4.5 to kill bogon emissions?

If I fix the TOPS-20 servers to stop replying to bogons, I can
presumably give the owners back 1/2 of the cycles that bogons are
eating.

Will this:

A) do bad things to the BIND 4.5s sending the bogons

B) cause them to retransmit?

C) both

What about if I change the root servers to send back format errors?

Something has to be done, and soon.  I don't really want to chance
breaking all of the BIND 4.5s out there, but I want them to stop hitting
the root servers.  Any suggestions before replies to bogons are turned
off?
