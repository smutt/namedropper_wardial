A friend of mine has been having some problems configuring a name
server.   The primary master server is on a Sun and serves a LAN.
This LAN (LAN #1) is bridged to another LAN (LAN #2) so that both
LAN's appear as to be the same.

The hosts on LAN #1 however are in a different zone than those on
LAN  #2.   Everything was running perfectly until the repeater to
LAN #1 went out, isolating LAN #1.  What he found was  that  when
using  nslookup,  when hosts were addressed by their non-expanded
name or alias, the address resolution would  occur  as  expected.
When a fully qualified name was used, the search would fail.  Ex-
ample:

        "abc" would obtain the address for abc.x.ab.com ok.

        "abc.x.ab.com" would fail.

What appeared to be happening was that the  later  request  would
somehow filter up to LAN #1 , and then somehow get resolved.  The
question is why?  It seems that this is  not  a  normal  type  of
behaviour, and that all requests within a zone should be resolved
without going outside of the zone.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
