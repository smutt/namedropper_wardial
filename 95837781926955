I second Dave Plummer's concerns.  It was my understanding that the names
weren't supposed to be limited to naming zones, hosts, and mailboxes.  They
were just supposed to be names for whatever one cared to name, but it
doesn't seem to have worked out that way.  To expand on Dave's wish list, I
would like the list of types of objects named in such a service to be
extensible so that I don't have to know now all the sorts of objects I'd
ever like to be able to name.  Of course, that leads to another naming
problem, but that's our business, so I'm not too worried about that.

But this isn't to say that the domain system isn't an improvement over what
existed before.  The sorts of statements that I and Dave Plummer and
whoever else are making are wish lists, and maybe it is time to begin over
with a newer, more general name service.  Anything of that scope will take
several years anyway, and in the meantime we can put the energy and thought
that would go into criticism to some constructive use.
