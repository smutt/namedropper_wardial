There was a Domain working group meeting at the IETF in Austin.  It
wasn't unlisted because of some desire to keep it closed or secret, but
rather because the IETF management tries to dispose of any WG that seems
to have cleared its agenda, lest they become coffee clubs.  Lean and
mean is in...

In any case, although there were several things that were listed as
issues in the WG, the prime topic was adding a facility for network
names to the domain tree.  This issue was discussed on NAMEDROPPERS for
a couple of days just before the Virus/Worm, which cut discussion short.
Several schemes were proposed, and one was selected to be written up for
wider comment, the path to RFC-hood, etc.  Somehow I both lost the
argument of how to do it, and got the job of writing it up.  Watch for
a draft in the near future.

With regard to the type of service, I think that it's important to note
that this sort of thing is necessary in the interface to the domain
system, but should not be injected into implementations of the protocols
themselves.  Rob explained one choice.  My favorite example of why you
might want such a feature is how the resolver should find out the
addresses associated with a name server without self destructing in
infinite loops, delaying to long, or giving up too easily.
