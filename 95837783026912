Suppose the following record is in the database file for the LCS.MIT.EDU
zone:
	*.LCS.MIT.EDU MX IN    &lt;data&gt;
Further suppose there there are no (explicit) records for
FOOBARBAZ.LCS,MIT.EDU.

(1) What should happen if I ask an authoritative server for the Internet
MX records for FOOBARBAZ?
	I think everybody agrees it should respond with the associated
	data, and a couple of weeks ago both XX.LCS.MIT.EDU and
	ALLSPICE.LCS.MIT.EDU did this correctly.

(2) What should happen if I ask an authoritative server for the Internet
Address records for FOOBARBAZ?  Should it give me a name-error, or
should it reply no-error (with no data)?
	A couple weeks ago: XX.LCS.MIT.EDU gave an authoritative
	name-error (with an SOA record for negative caching).
	ALLSPICE.LCS.MIT.EDU gave an authoritative no-error.

(3) If I happened to ask XX, and got the name-error, should I cache the
negative response for the name, or for the name/qtype/qclass tripple?
	I think it only makes sense to cache it for the name alone.  If
	the name/qtype/qclass were cached, I see no semantic or
	practical difference between name-error and no-error (with no
	data), except the name-error often supplies the SOA saying how
	long to cache the lack of data.  Also, declaring that the /name/
	doesn't exist should allow me to avoid future network traffic
	since I won't need to ask about host info, WKS or other things
	until the cache times out.

(4) If I happened to ask XX, got the name error, and cached the name
error for the name, what should happen if I consult my database/cache for
the MX records for FOOBARBAZ?
	From the discussion of (3) above, I should get an immediate
	answer of name-error because the name-error was cached.  But if
	it weren't cached, I would ask a server, as in (1), and get an
	authoritative no-error answer with data.  This is an
	inconsistency, and I believe it to be a practical one.  I
	believe the inconsistency arises in (2), in the case that XX
	should not have replied name-error because there was a record
	that covered the name, even if it didn't cover the question
	being asked.  Another practical note: For systems that do want
	all of host-info, address, WKS and others, giving no-error
	requires each of these questions to be asked, degrading
	application performance and adding network load (see discussion
	of (3).

(5, extra credit) If I happened to ask for the MX record first, cached
it, and then asked for the address record and got a name-error, what
should happen?  (E.g., Should the MX get decached?)
