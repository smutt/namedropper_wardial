    So maby the spec should be changed to allow the SOA field to include
    either a MINIMUM or a DEFAULT TTL for a zone.  What was the reason for
    choosing a minimum instead of a default anyway?  (Should this discussion
    move to namedroppers?)

[So moved.]

One could argue that TTLs should not be associated with records at all,
but should instead be associated with zones.  This "fixes" several
problems (and probably introduces a few in the process).  The only way a
record could become invalid is if the zone has changed.  Therefore, when
a zone becomes potentially out of date all the records of that zone
become potentially out of date.  When you touch a record that is out of
date, you query the zone.  If the zone isn't out of date, all records
reset their (effective) TTLs.  If the zone is out of date, then even a
recent record could be out of date, despite its TTL.  Optimizations
could include asking the zone "What has changed since version N" so that
you could automatically revive records that haven't been changed without
explicitly revalidating them as well as explicitly marking records as
out-of-date that are known to have changed, possibly doing the update in
the background.  These ideas aren't new; the Symbolics namespace system
has been doing this for about 3.5 years now.
