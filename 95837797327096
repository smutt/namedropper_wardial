     Now I was trying to be official and put in the correct values for the
     System name, but it appears that "SUN OS 4.0" is incorrect because of
     the spaces (and to a lesser extent, the periods.  rfc1010 quite
     clearly states that both periods and spaces are not allowed, and
     rfc1033 at least implies that spaces are not allowed.
     
     The questions is what to do: "SUNOS-4.0" comes to mind, but that does
     have a period in it.
     
     I suppose the other question might be does any program use the HINFO
     field.  A human would obviously not care whether the period (or space)
     is there or not, while a program certainly might.  Does bind itself
     care/notice?
     

I gave up on the "official names" a long time ago.  They aren't
complete (although they're better than they used to be), and they're
released at intervals too infrequent to keep up with the industry.
Since we have at least one of just about every box Sun makes, and
usually have them before they're announced, I had to do something.

Personally, I use names like

	SUN-3/50	SUN-3/60	SUN-4/60	SUN-4/390

for the machine type.  This at least follows the style of the official
names, although many of the names I use aren't in the official list,
yet.  I use names like

	UNIX3.5		UNIX4.0.3	UNIX4.1

for the operating system type.  I've thought about changing "UNIX" to
"SUNOS" or "SunOS" several times, but haven't felt like editing all
those files...

Anyway, this is all with BIND 4.8.1, and it doesn't seem to mind the
dots in the names.
