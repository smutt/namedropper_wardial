&gt;   Normally this isn't a problem since most of the clients requesting name
&gt; or address resolution are things like telnet, ftp, etc. and the users
&gt; invoking those programs eventually type ^C and try again later.  But if
&gt; the client is sendmail, it doesn't get tired (Sun OS 3.5 and earlier).

This is not true -- the name server time out was added to sendmail in
SunOS 3.2, more than two years ago.  But you are right, you should probably
run the sendmail.mx directly linked with the resolver.  We only run it on
our single mail gateway machine, so that we do not have to hack all five
thousand workstations.  All other machines just pass mail up
to the gateway unless it is in the current domain.

Here is a message with more up-to-date information that I seem to send
out every few weeks:
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use the feature that allows the YP server to use the
name server when it does not find the name in the local domain, then
you can use the "-i" option on your ypserv line in rc.local.  In SunOS
4.0 this was replaced by the "-b" option of makedbm, but, alas, it was
broken in the first shipment of 4.0.  The fix is in 4.0.1, which is now
shipping on request. Contact Sun Customer Support to get the patch
immediately if you need it.  Also available from Customer Support is a
version of BIND 4.8 and sendmail with MX record handling, which is
planned for the next release, although these binaries can be run under
3.x or 4.x.  The name server in 4.0 was based on 4.7.3, and the 3.x
releases were based on BIND 4.5, so you might consider getting the
latest version if you have problems.  The sendmail MX support in 4.0
was based on sendmail 5.54, and the latest one is based on 5.59.  Ask
your service representative for the "Name Server Patch Kit".

If you want to link your programs directly with the resolver, this is
more work.  You can link all sources with -lresolv in 3.x.  In 4.x you
have dynamic linking, so you do not need to relink all the programs in
the world, but you do need to rebuild the shared library.  A few brave
people have already done this, but it is not recommended for the weak
of heart. A position-independent version of libc.a is now available on
request, and should be in the next release.  This allows you to replace
modules from the standard library and insert your own more easily.
