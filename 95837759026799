(Be forewarned, this is about a page long)

I've been pondering using them at a point in the medium-term-future, but I'm 
not rushing into it precisely because I'm not very confident that the dynamics 
of such a mail world are well enough understood.  In other words, I'm afraid I 
might be shooting myself in the foot if I did this now.

I think I don't quite agree that MR should be just like CNAME, but I might yet 
change my mind on that.  Not having to chase chains of pointers would indeed be
nice, but CNAME only avoids this because it places the burden on the domain 
admin to know the "real" name.  This is a more difficult problem for mailboxes 
than it is for hosts, because mailboxes are more transient and migratory in 
nature.  Wishing this problem away won't make it disappear - it just ends up in
someone else's lap.  (If A@B moves to become A@C and B concurrently establishes
A.B CNAME A.C, and then at some later date A@C moves again to become A@D and C 
establishes A.C CNAME A.D, B is now "out of spec" through no fault of its own.)
 The ultimate question is how much of whose effort it's worth to have "the 
system" keep track of people's (mailboxes') migrations over long periods of 
time, as opposed to having the people who generate mail take responsibility for
knowing the current or immediately prior address.  There are other options too,
and I suspect this is a religious question.

I definitely think it would be inappropriate for every name mapping to be 
represented by a MR.  It should be used judiciously.  It might be wise not to 
rename Postmaster to something else, for example.  On the other hand, there are
cases where MR is of great value.  I expect to suffer considerable pain about a
year from now due to the lack of widespread implementation of it (or something 
like it).  I expect to have to move a mailbox which has a mail volume of 
perhaps 500,000 items a year.  It will be moving to a point which is rather 
distant in Internet name space and beyond my administrative control.  Certainly
I do not wish to receive and re-mail such a traffic volume for however long it 
takes all the correspondents (mostly in foreign countries) to get and 
understand the word that they should be mailing to some other host name.  Not 
to worry, I have a plan for avoiding being sunk in mailforwarding, but if we 
had a solid network-wide implementation of MR functionality, my plan could be a
lot simpler.

I think mailbox binding is a useful enough concept to be worth a try.  I do 
have some doubts about whether the current formulation of it is a winning one. 
On the other hand, I'm a little bit concerned that if nobody ever starts trying
to use it, we'll never make any progress on improving the formulation.

Perhaps it will occur that CCITT-ish directory services will be viable by the 
time this becomes relevant anyway.  Or perhaps they will be invented and turn 
out not to be viable because of a lack of sufficient real world experimentation
to find the problem areas.  Even if Internet domain server style mailbox 
binding does come into use, there will still be an issue of how to cope with 
X.400ish addressing.  I had the feeling from what I've seen of the ARPA-MHS 
address encapsulation schemes that there could be problems with the 
ARPA-encoded MHS address having a local part of length &gt; 64, which would cause 
real trouble for mailbox binding of X.400ish O/Rs on the Internet (and I 
presume there will someday come to be a number of those).  I don't know enough 
to point the way to the exit from this maze.
