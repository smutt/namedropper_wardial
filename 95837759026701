&gt;&gt; First, it would be of great benefit if the method of choosing your list of
&gt;&gt; rules could be turned into an algorithm applicable anywhere in the domain
&gt;&gt; tree.  Then there wouldn't have to be so much thought placed when setting
&gt;&gt; up each host; there would be fewer opportunities for mistakes; and users
&gt;&gt; would have a more predictable idea of what to expect when they move to a
&gt;&gt; different host.

Yes.  This would be ideal.  Rudy Nedved mentioned it the troubles they
had.  I can't dream up one algorithm that would have the high degree
of success in choosing the right completion the first time than can be
achieved in a configurable environment.

&gt;&gt; The list of rules at a host depends on the position of that host and other
&gt;&gt; domain names in the tree.  In your examples, the rules depend on domains
&gt;&gt; that are ancestors of the host in question, siblings of ancestors (aunts
&gt;&gt; and uncles), and children of siblings (cousins). I think the last is
&gt;&gt; taking it too far.  While might be reasonable for OZ.AI.MIT.EDU to keep
&gt;&gt; track of subdomains of LCS.MIT.EDU, it would be much harder for
&gt;&gt; SAIL.Stanford.EDU to keep track of subdomains of Purdue.EDU, even though
&gt;&gt; the relative positions are the same.  (Maybe not really harder, but there
&gt;&gt; are many subdomains of EDU that we'd have to keep information about.)

Yes.  This is open to abuse and inefficiency.  The system administrator is free
to set up whatever rules they decide to use.  That can range from the bare
minimum of only one default domain (your own) to knowing about the complete
tree.  Your response time would vary accordingly.  I would suggest as a
guideline staying within your "master" administrative domain.  For us that
would be Purdue.  For you that would be Stanford.

&gt;&gt; All of the proposals so far assume the host making the completion is a
&gt;&gt; leaf in the tree (and perhaps that the target host is a leaf too).  It
&gt;&gt; should be generalized to allow the host to have a domain name with
&gt;&gt; subdomains.  Doing this seems straightforward.

I see what you are saying.  An example might be if someone in the ecn
subdomain wanted to mail to someone in the cs subdomain, they would want
to address the letter as "user@cs".  (The previously mentioned rules
would only match ".cs".)  We would designate one or more hosts
to receive mail to letters addressed "user@cs.purdue.edu." so that letter
would get the right place eventually.

This could be achieved by setting up the rules to match "cs" instead of
".cs".  We would have to be careful not to have this rule match names
it wasn't meant to like "user@arcs".  The trailing "cs" of "arcs" is
not meant to be a domain.
