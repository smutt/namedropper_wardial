Folks,

We have domain namesolvers installed now in fuzzballs in Germany and in
several Ford and U of Michigan hosts with rickety plumbing to the ARPANET.
The fuzzball in Germany is on MILNET and resolves everything from the NIC
at its MILNET address, while the other fuzzballs resolve only non-ARPA
domains from the NIC at its ARPANET address.

Today the NIC has been bobbing up and down, while the ARPANET/MILNET
service seems badly congested, so I have been watching to see how well
things like the mail system cope. Among the interesting things observed:

1. Our mail system insisted on checking that a mail destination was valid
   (for possible forwarding) before accepting a recipient with a 2xx
   reply. If not, a 5xx reply was returned. Now, however, the validity
   checking can return less than an authoritative "no," so a 4xx reply
   needs to be returned in that case.

2. There were lots of places in the system where the local host name
   was needed, like in the SMTP herald, for example. However, in our
   zeal for delayed binding the name was not bound until actual use,
   thus the poor host may come up empty when it tries to resolve its
   own name! We haven't given up on that, but do now return the [n.n.n.n]
   format "name" when the namesolver returns a non-authoritative "no."
   (What happens if the namesolver returns an authoritative "no" when
   a host attempts to resolve (inversely) its own name is a topic for
   further study...).

3. An exhaustive search to verify names as the mail comes in is probably
   not a Sterling idea if the receiving host does not cache. In the case
   of a noisy link to a name server, as I observed today, the mail
   sender can be delayed a lot as each recipient grinds through the
   retry timeouts. In order to minimize holding times, our mail sender
   already resolves all of the host names in the mailbag before trying
   to contact the destination hosts.
