&gt; I suspect (only a first level suspect, I haven't spent time
&gt; looking at it very much at all) that the incorrect response to
&gt; losing queries is in some fashion related to the server choking on
&gt; invalid data in the address files.  Up until last week, ns.nasa.gov
&gt; also served about 7 local primaries, with the result being
&gt; regular changes to the associated files.  (Not the root distributions,
&gt; of course, but others.)

&gt; It is interesting to note that the breakdowns were first noted (or
&gt; at least mentioned out loud) when I went away on vacation.  I do not have
&gt; normal responsibility for adding new hosts to the local primaries,
&gt; but I did monitor syslog and note when someone adding such a host
&gt; made a typo, resulting in complaints from bind.  I would also then
&gt; quickly see to its correction.  Apparently others were not so careful, as
&gt; while I was gone, such errors hung around for some time.

    If by 'invalid data in the address file' you mean syntactically
incorrect data, you can add an extra fire-wall between the zone files
and the 'main' server for the zone by making the 'main' server a
secondary for the zone and having it copy the zone from a machine
which isn't delegated authority for the zone. That way hopefully
the person who makes the changes sees the syslog() error before
the zone gets updated.

    Has anyone stripped the code out of BIND to parse zone files,
creating a tool to 'check' files with before having BIND reload them?
