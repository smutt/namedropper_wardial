Paul,

I like the direction your proposals are taking, especially now that
they're considering the problem of the same subdomain name appearing in
several places.  Let me make a few comments, without suggesting solutions
(because I'm lazy and maybe someone else will find the answers).

First, it would be of great benefit if the method of choosing your list of
rules could be turned into an algorithm applicable anywhere in the domain
tree.  Then there wouldn't have to be so much thought placed when setting
up each host; there would be fewer opportunities for mistakes; and users
would have a more predictable idea of what to expect when they move to a
different host.

The list of rules at a host depends on the position of that host and other
domain names in the tree.  In your examples, the rules depend on domains
that are ancestors of the host in question, siblings of ancestors (aunts
and uncles), and children of siblings (cousins). I think the last is
taking it too far.  While might be reasonable for OZ.AI.MIT.EDU to keep
track of subdomains of LCS.MIT.EDU, it would be much harder for
SAIL.Stanford.EDU to keep track of subdomains of Purdue.EDU, even though
the relative positions are the same.  (Maybe not really harder, but there
are many subdomains of EDU that we'd have to keep information about.)

The domains being considered in making up these rules should be assumed to
change over time.  Therefore the rules should not be hardwired, but should
depend on cached information which is timed out.  When such a timeout
happens, a resolver should query to find out the complete set of
subdomains at each level it is concerned with, and assume until the next
timeout that there are no other subdomains in that set, in order to avoid
making queries that are likely to fail.  (This goes a long way toward
fixing the problem of user typos causing queries to go all the way to the
root server.)  Of course the answer to such a query should have identical
timeouts for all records.

All of the proposals so far assume the host making the completion is a
leaf in the tree (and perhaps that the target host is a leaf too).  It
should be generalized to allow the host to have a domain name with
subdomains.  Doing this seems straightforward.

Keep the suggestions flowing!

						Joe
