The question was:

	Should there be an A record for a domain name itself?

Out of 26 responses, 17 said "yes", 7 said "no", and 2 were ambivalent.

Some of the arguments/reasons were:

PRO:

- It's the machine which will accept mail for the entire domain, plus will
  accept FTP and TELNET connections.

- Providing an A RR for the domain lets people with mailers that don't
  understand MX records still send mail to you.

CON:

- The lookup of the PTR record for this address won't match what you get
  via a forward lookup.  [Well, it will give you the proper hostname of
  the machine instead of the domain name, but it's not like that's a
  *wrong* answer.]

OTHER COMMENTS RECEIVED:

- No real reason to do it unless you hide hosts in the domain.  (I.e.,
  send all mail as "From: user@domain" instead of "From: user@host.domain").

- A newer convention than FTP to the domain name is to have a CNAME
  for a host called "ftp" which points at the FTP host (e.g.
  <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net" rel="nofollow">ftp.uu.net</a>).

- Ohio State has 4 A RRs for their domain name; each identifies one of
  the central servers.  [As I understand it, NFS and such make these
  machines all equivalent as far as network connections, FTP, etc. go.]

- Some people made arguments based on whether there's actually a
  machine with that name.  If so, then yes.  If not, then no.  [This
  seemed like sort of a weird argument to me - names are whatever you
  want them to be.]

- A CNAME record for the domain is never appropriate.

Thanks for all the responses.  I've decided that at least for our domain,
having an A record for the domain name is the Right Thing to do.
