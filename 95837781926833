    Philip:

    Somehow we have a hard time getting you to understand that the EDU, COM.
    etc top level domains are world wide.  An (appropriate) orgaization from
    any country can join them.

    The US domain does not and will not have COM, EDU, etc as sub domains.

    --jon.

Well Jon, it seems that we have done such a fine job defining
generic multi-national organizational domains that the US domain
is going to remain empty for some time.  There is no need to
put some university in the US domain if it will go in the EDU
domain...

It is interesting that the British have registered universities
within the ACademic domain within their national domain (UK), and not
within the EDU domain (for the most part).  Is this another manifestation
of driving on the wrong side of the road and writing addresses
left-to-right?

In any case, it seems that these may be too non-specific.  For
instance, would Kent.Edu be Kent State University or the University of
Kent County in England?  British foresight has prevented this conflict,
at the cost of consistency.

Yet it remains that these generic non-national domains do not provide
enough information to prevent ambiguity.

Yes, having IBM.COM is better than having IBM.US, IBM.UK, IBM.JP, etc.
IBM is unambiguous.  `Kent' is not, `Concordia' is not, `Carleton' is
not.

I think having a US domain is a Good Idea, but the criteria for the
other domains (COM, EDU, etc) is so ambiguous that no one really wants
or needs to be in the US domain.  And who wants to be in both?  That's
twice as much maintenance to do...

I guess Mark (Horton) hit the nail on the head we he pointed out that
no one had thought of a consistent way to sub-domain US.  By county,
telephone area code, city, what?  If it can't be by function (COM, EDU,
etc) it will have to be by geography...

If we go by state, then what to do about multi-state organizations
(like AT&amp;T, etc)?  Wait, I know!!!

I can't see an viable solution...
