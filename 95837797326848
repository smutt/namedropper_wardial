You are correct on both counts: it isn't specified very well in the
RFCs, and BIND sends and wants one RR at a time (at least the version
I played with last did).

Thus the de facto situation is that folks implement it this way so
that they can interwork with BIND.

This is certainly different from the intent of the designers.

The original thoughts as I remember them:

Send the SOA in the first and the last to delimit the transfer.  If
the serial changes then the zone received updates during the transfer,
but the transmitted first SOA and everything up to the last SOA should
represent a consistent zone image as at the first serial number.  This
is critical since you can get in big trouble using intermediates.  (If
the database in question makes this impossible, abort the transfer
with an error.)

Since the assumption is that the most frequent use would be between
compatible versions, transmit the contents of the zone in whatever
order makes storage/encoding/etc most efficient.  For example, if the
databases were tree-oriented, a depth-first or breadth-first tree walk
might be selected depending on characteristics of the implementation.

The general model was that each DNS packet might have all of the data
for a single node or whatever.  Larger (perhaps multiple nodes) was
preferred since bigger packets are more efficient in general and
compression saves more.  (Note BIND doesn't like compression in zone
transfers now.)
