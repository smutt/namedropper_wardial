The paragraph at the top of page 40 of RFC883 ends with

	"... If a query is received for the A record, the name server
	 will pass back a referaal to the name server with the A record
	 in the additional section, rather than [in the] answer section."

I decided to check this out.

If I ask SRI-NIC.ARPA or C.ISI.EDU for the Internet Address record(s) of
BITSY.MIT.EDU, it does what the spec says: it returns referals and
includes the address RR in question in the additional section.

If I ask BRL-AOS.ARPA for the Internet Address record(s) of
BITSY.MIT.EDU I get something different.  I get an authoritative answer,
plus I get referals.  The address RR is in both the answer field and the
additional field.  This is wrong, I believe in two ways.  First, there
shouldn't be anything in the answer field.  Second, it shouldn't be
authoritative (more on this below).

Also, it raises the question: What does an authoritative answer plus
referals mean?

If I ask BITSY.MIT.EDU for the Internet Address record(s) of
HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU I get something yet again different.  This time I get
an authoritative answer, with one address RR, and no referals.  The new
wrongness here is that I should get referals.

To make matter worse, if I ask HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU for it's own Internet
Address record(s) I get authoritatively THREE, which is different than
the authoritative single RR that BITSY gave me.  Who should I believe?

The end of the third paragraph on the same page (page 40) also states:

	"... By definition, data from a master file is authoritative."

Is it really?  All of it?  If so, then BITSY is in bounds by telling me
authoritatively that HERMES has one address.  But isn't this a
contradiction with the first paragraph, which says that referals should
be generated?

Help!  Does the spec need clarifying?  Do implementations need fixing?
How can I guard against incorrect implementations?
