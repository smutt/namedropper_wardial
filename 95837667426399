I really like and appreciate Charles Hornig's experiment.  Of course,
all host names should be in the HOSTS.TXT file, even the new style
domain names (such as, "HUDSON.SCRC.SYMBOLICS.COM").  The host 
administrator and or technical liaison for each host should make sure
that any domain style name it is using is listed in the NIC's HOSTS.TXT
file before using the new name.  It would really be interesting to repeat
Charles' experiment on a monthly basis for the next few months.  I think
the experiment has to be a bit more subtle though.  We certainly want to
identify any hosts that can't handle the new names even though the new names
are in HOSTS.TXT.  And it would be very interesting to be able to tell
which hosts use HOSTS.TXT and which use the Domain Service to look up
names.  Charles' experiment does the first, but i am not sure how to set
up an experiment to do the second test (perhaps using an experimental host
purposely not listed in HOSTS.TXT but included in the Domain Service data).
In any case, we are really starting to put a substantially new concept and
mechanism into service.  There will be some bugs in getting it started and
some frustration for the individuals caught by the bugs.  I'd appreciate
hearing about any problems right away when they are discovered.  And 
remember, the better documented and more detailed the problem report, the
better i'll be able to help resolve the problem.
