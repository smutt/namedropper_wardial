In reply to my posting:
| I am slowily migrating most of the network services off our
| BSD/VAX.  I would like to move the main DNS server to a
| highly reliable system.  I would like to know what others
| have done, especially in the realm of using dedicated boxes
| (such as using a PC or standalone workstation).

Of the three responses, all were using UNIX systems. Yale appears
to actually deciating an RT to the task (and I know of other sites
using a dedicated workstation also, but to responses from them).

So, this is what I did.  I moved the primary to our new mailhub
(a Sun-4).  I have one off-site secondary and soon another on-site
secondary, hopefully on our Multimax or a dedicated 286.  So does
anyone have software to turn a PC into a DNS secondary NS?

| I have an IBM RT (model 6150) running AOS (IBM's 4.3 code) serving as a
| campus name server, mailer, news server, and (soon) Internet/BITNET gateway.
| I had to install new sendmail (5.59) and BIND (4.8+) to replace the out of
| date stuff shipped by IBM, but most vendors seem to be shipping old name
| service and mail stuff these days.  The RT makes a nice little network
| box.  I also have it doing subnet routing with two ether interfaces.
| I've been pretty pleased with the box itself and the software, but the
| sales support from IBM has been poor and IBM seems to be abandoning AOS in
| favor of AIX.  We'll see....

&gt;From Tim Smith &lt;tsmith@cad.usna.mil&gt;:
| I did exactly this at the Naval Academy before I left their employ. My
| choice was to use a Sun workstation. USNA was using a 780 as the
| MILnet gateway, main name server, UUCP machine, and general purpose
| time sharing machine (and it was slooow!). 
| 
| I went one step further in that I also moved the MILnet link to the
| same stand alone machine (using SunlinkDDN 6.0).  I originaly planned
| to use a Sun 3/50 but after trying it for a while found that the 3/50
| was just a bit to slow- some folks inside sun explained to me that the
| 3/50 "does not use real vectored interupts" (do not ask me what they
| use- I am just relaying what I was told) and that a 3/60 would be a
| much better choice.
| 
| I happend to have a 3/60 availible so it was set up as the MILnet
| gateway, main mail host, and main name server.  Last time I checked
| 3/60 was doing great- a major improvement over the tired old vax.
| 
| I would strongly reccomend not using a PC- PCs are not well suited
| to what you would be asking it to do and they are a real pain. Using a
| common workstation (like a sun or dec) means that you will not have to
| spend as much time porting software and also that you can have easy
| access to all of the sources the machine uses- 2 big wins as far as I
| am concerned.


&gt;From H. Morrow Long &lt;long-morrow@yale.edu&gt;:
| We use IBM PC/RTs running 4.3BSD Unix (the special AOS product
| with a special part number from IBM) as dedicated network servers
| running services such as gated, named, snmpd, etc. with no problem.
| BSD/Vax software ports with little work.  The machine itself
| is reasonably peppy (although not when compared to the current crop of
| 12+ MIPs workstations such as SparcStation 1s and DECstation 3100s).
| 
| There is also a IBM PC/RT running AIX (the ATT System Vish, OSFish
| Unix version) with gated and named running (at the main computer
| center.
| 
| We were given these machines for next to nothing so these have turned
| out to be good uses of these boxes.
