Marten,
&gt; [Using BIND 4.8] We ask for the NS records for the domain it. (this is
&gt; Italy).  First time, no answer is found. Then we ask for a non-existing
&gt; host in the domain it , monkey.it. The DNS comes up with a SOA record
&gt; for it.  If we again ask for the NS records for it. we now get an answer
&gt; consisting of lots of nameservers for domain it.  What went wrong the
&gt; first time ?

	It sounds like your named.boot file must set up a default
domain.  If it contains a line such as "domain mydomain.edu", here's
what happened.

	The first time: named got your query for "it".  It looked it up
in its cache, and found nothing.  Then, because "it" contains no dots
and you have a default domain, it appended the default domain to your
query (resulting in "it.mydomain.edu") and tried again.  This second
lookup determined that your server knew that "it.mydomain.edu" didn't
exist.  named then sent you a response saying that "it.mydomain.edu"
doesn't exist.

	The second time: named got your query for "monkey.it".  It
looked it up in its cache, and (as before) found nothing.  However,
since "monkey.it" contains an interior dot, named forwarded the query to
a root server instead of trying to append your default domain.  The root
server responded by referring you to the servers for the "it" domain...

	The third time: named got your query for "it".  It looked it up
in its cache, and this time found it because it cached the NS info it
got back when you asked about "monkey.it".

	The best fix would be to delete the default domain from your
named.boot file.  For a complicated set of reasons which are hinted at
above, domain experts generally agree that default domains should be
handled by resolvers rather than by name servers.  The only reason this
feature wasn't dropped entirely from 4.8 was that there used to be some
terminal servers whose software was so broken that their resolvers
couldn't be configured with default domains.
