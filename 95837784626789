Bob,
&gt; ...but I saw the
&gt; list of IETF meetings for Austin Texas and didn't see anything about a DOMAIN
&gt; IETF meeting. Are there no more problems to deal with?

	There actually was a short Domain Working Group meeting in
Austin, though it didn't make it onto the agenda that got sent out.
Paul Mockapetris (mockapetris@isi.edu) chaired the meeting.  The main
topic was translation between network names and network numbers, but
some consideration was also given to possible future tasks for the
group.

&gt;  I'm interested in who
&gt; is thinking about and discussing the Domain overlap/intersection/collision
&gt; between the INTERNET and ISO name space its impact on how to provide a name
&gt; server that addressses both domains.
	I'm not positive I fully understand the meaning of your
question, but I'll take a stab at it.  One possible approach to would be
to add ISO information to the current domain system.  Since the domain
system is (modulo a few rough edges) readily extensible to new QTYPEs
and QCLASSes, adding things such as ISO addresses shouldn't be too hard.
ISO names would be more problematic, though.  The set of allowable names
would have to be restricted to those that can be represented in the
hierarchical fashion that the domain system requires.

	In some circles, thought has been given to the opposite
approach, replacing the current domain system with X.500.  I believe
that Dave Clark's people at MIT are looking at whether this would be
feasible.  Unfortunately, full implementation of the X.500 spec is still
beyond the current state of the art in computer science (one woman I
know is writing her PhD thesis on some of the problems).

	A third possibility was precluded by the wording of your
question but deserves consideration anyway: use separate name servers
for IP and ISO.  Process slots are reasonably cheap in most OS's, and
the software modifications implied by either of the two previous
solutions are not.  Is there really a substantial benefit to having a
combined IP and ISO name server?
