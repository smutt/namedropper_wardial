Larry:

I quite agree with your note on the advantages of an attribute-based
naming system.  The CCITT and ISO are pushing very hard for standards
for precisely that type of services, and work in IFIP 6.5 dates to
early 1980's.  There are many papers on the subject (IFIP 6.5
conferences, for eaxample), but the burning question is what about
prototypes and experiences?  It may be that people in Europe have their
own prototypes, given the strong influence that CCITT and ISO standards
tend to have there.  I will try to dig up names if there is interest.

I am not as confident as you are in that "all technical problems
involved in building an attribute-based naming system have [been]
solved," I believe that the problem is new, is real, and that the
Internet task force has a very interesting, challenging, and rewarding
task at hand.

I have some questions for you and anyone else in the list:  How is the
CCITT work limited?  In the general case, I would like to name any
resource in the Internet and ask for it by what I know (attributes),
but is it realistic to have one such a server (or servers), or do we
need a hierarchy of servers dedicated to different things (e.g.,
people's addresses, or the location of programs or RFCs).  What do we
know about the dynamics of these "objects"?

	.....General questions to start (or continue) the flames.

Regards,

JJ
