|&gt;     This is another instance of the "the answer depends on who is
|&gt;asking" issue.  It has come up before with a desire to keep certain
|&gt;clients confidential and a desire to avoid extra cross-Atlantic
|&gt;hops in mail messages and a desire to select the BITNET gateway
|&gt;closest to the sender (or the receiver).
Then go on suggesting what to put in MX records, and an evaluation
strategy based on e.g. "a node in Europe could drop all the MX records
in North America..."

There are in fact several problems, which all have the same root: for
simplicity sake, the DNS was set up "has if all routes had the same
cost", and the MX hosts should only indicate the hosts which are the
most convenient for the receiver. One can think of two solutions for the
problem, one based on "distances" and the other one based on "visibility".

The solutions based on "distance" combine the MX "preference indicator"
with a local preference attached to the relay host, and attempt to sort
the relays on the sum of "MX preference" plus "local preference".
Bruce's suggestion is a variation on that scheme, with a local
preference function taking the value "0" (when the destination can be
reached) or "infinite" (when unreachable). It is in fact very hard to go
much further with the current scheme, as the preference indicators dont
qualify as "distances"; nothing prevent some domain to allocate the
preferences as "0:here, 1:nearby, 5:far-away", and some others to use
"0:here, 10:same-campus, 20:same-region, 50:same-country"...

*QUESTION: would it be possible to transform the MX so that they
indicate a real "distance"? This would in particular make the "grouping"
of transatlantic mail much more efficient.

The solution implemented in Germany is based on "visibility". The idea
is that some informations are visible only within some domains. For
example, the FR domain contains some commercial subnets which are
connected to the French infrastructure, but are not allowed to use the
NSFNET; listing their sites in the MX records would be very helpful in
France, but would be very unfriendly to our US partners, which will get
the info (MX, A, etc), but will see their connection attempts fail
because "this net is unreachable". The dumb systems will sit there and
fail; the smarter will apply the strategy defined by Bruce; all will
somewhat suffer. Hence the German "lies", which try to give "only that
information which can be useful". The German implementation is in fact
poor, because it also deprives the net from a lot of useful information;
but one could imagine a smarter "visibility" rule by using the "class"
information.

The class field was originally inserted for taking care of different
networks, e.g. IP and CHAOS. One could probably use it for defining
visibility rules, e.g. "get an MX record in the German class for domain
xxx.de" vs "get an MX record in the INTERNET class for domain xxx.de"
(or in the European class for the fringes). Bringing different answer,
e.g. the target host in one case, the German gateway in another, would
be perfectly reasonable. 

*QUESTION: How difficult would it be to instruct mailers to get their MX
from one of several classes, and to instruct name-servers to send all
related MX-RR in reply to a query?
