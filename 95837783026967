By the way, several people are a little confused about the fine points
of this scheme.

If, in the current DNS system and usage, you had say,
Namedroppers@mail.list and TCP@mail.list then submissions to either
would be directed at one or more mail exchanges, say SRI-NIC.ARPA and
NNSC.NSF.NET.  That is, the database would contain:

mail.list.	MX	10	SRI-NIC.ARPA.
		MX	10	NNSC.NSF.NET.

(Again, these hosts and preferences are just examples, you could set up
more alternatives, fewer alternatives, different preferences, etc.)

Note that for this part of the action, whether mail is sent to TCP-IP or
Namedroppers has not yet entered into it.

Once the submission gets to a mail exchange for mail.list, the mailer
there might use the TCP-IP or Namedroppers part of the address to route
the mail to the host or mailbox which is really going to do the
exploding.  Thus, in the above example, both SRI-NIC.ARPA and
NNSC.NSF.NET might know to send Namedroppers mail to
SOMEWHERE-ELSE.Fresno.CA.US or whatever, and that host would do the
automatic exploding, put it in an editor's mailbox for digestifying, or
whatever else needed to be done.

Thus although the mail exchanges for mail.list would have to know
the identity of the host, mailbox or whatever that was going to do the
exploding or whatever, they do NOT have to know the list membership or
track changes in it.

Furthermore, you could unilaterally decide to put this hack together
assuming that you could get the NIC to allocate mail.list (or whatever
name you chose) and could set up mail exchanges that knew, for example,
to map mail sent to Namedroppers@mail.list to Namedroppers@SRI-NIC.ARPA.
(Don't forget X-request as well as X for all X).

Two closing comments: Of course you could put together something more
exciting by using mailbox addressing.  Of course you can combine this
scheme and a little pilot errror and fly this thing into a mail loop
mountainside.
