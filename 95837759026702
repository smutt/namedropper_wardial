I think this topic is relevant to namedroppers rather than just to bind,
where the discussion began.  The topic is: how should workstations which
are not registered in HOSTS.TXT format their mail return-addresses so
MILNET hosts can reply to them.  I.E., should they use

		user%workstation@nic-registered-host
	or	user@nic-registered-host
	or	user@workstation

First let me note that this topic is also relevant now for Arpanet
hosts which are not running domain servers (which I imagine is still
the majority).  

And in fact there are several issues bound up here.  What do we do
UNTIL Arpanet hosts are all supposed to be running domain servers?
What do we do AFTER Arpanet hosts are all supposed to be running
domain servers?  And should workstations deal with this problem differently
than other nosts not registered in the NIC table, since perhaps
people "don't really want to receive mail at their workstations"?

So note there are three times of interest:
	Now
	When Arpanet hosts "all" have to run domain servers
	When Milnet hosts "all" have to run domain servers

Do we want the mail programs on every non-registered host changed at
all three of these times?  Sounds like a lot of effort to me.

One possible view is the following: it seems crazy to go and create
this elaborate domain system and them try and circumvent it for a long 
time because a few MILNET hosts don't use domain servers.  Perhaps
we should ignore them.  This is probably largely a question of politics,
but the numbers should also be of interest, i.g., we wouldn't worry if
there were only 2 MILNET hosts.  I count roughly 370 of them (excluding
TACs).  I wonder how many non-NIC-registered Internet hosts there are;
does anyone have a clue?

I won't suggest a technical solution, because in fact I think all
of the above addresses are reasonable.  However, I will suggest the
following:

In order to reduce the approaching chaos, I suggest that the community
adopt the following convention.  Consider an organization whose hosts
are named within some domain, e.g., for Stanford it's  Stanford.EDU .
This organization should have a host named  Stanford.EDU  which is
registered with the NIC and which runs domain servers and can
forward mail to every host within its domain.  This way, if all else
fails some poor soul who can't automatically reply to
buddy-holly.Stanford.EDU  can easily hand-craft a reply to  Stanford.EDU
without having to spend a lot of time trying to figure out the name of
some host within the  Stanford.EDU  domain which is both NIC-registered
and can forward to buddy-holly  (e.g.,  Score.Stanford.EDU).
