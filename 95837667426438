Dave:

I'd like to comment on several of the points you raised:

First, the first UDP packet you send to the RICE.EDU name server is
*very* likeley to be lost while trying to open an X.25 connection at
the link level between CSNET-PDN-GW and RICE.  In general the second
will succeed, but since many resolvers seem to try their alternatives
in strict rotation with one packet transmission per address, RICE.EDU's
primary address will rarely see any queries.

At the moment we have the same problem from our end.  When trying to
resolve a query, RICE.EDU first tries the NIC, but the packet is lost.
Next, it tries ISIF and succeeds, but ISIF has an old database, so we
are usually told "No such domain".  Sigh...  At this point my only
solution is to create just enough traffic to keep an X.25 channel open
at all times.  What fun.  Also, are there any up-to-date root name
servers other than the NIC?

Second, in both your examples (Rice and Berkeley name servers), one
problem was that you received no answer from the host's secondary
address (the host interface further from DCN6).  I just tried
UCB-ARPA.BERKELEY.EDU at both its addresses, and got responses.  I
tried the same test on RICE.EDU from another host on our local network,
and again got responses from both addresses.

Hypothesis (untested):  Since both name server hosts in question are
VAXen running BIND, perhaps they are returning the wrong source address
in their response, and the Fuzzling is filtering out that packet.  I'll
try to see whether that's the problem.

Third, I believe you are correct in questioning the PURDUE.EDU
records in the response from the NIC.  As Larry pointed out, the
RICE.EDU and PURDUE.EDU name servers back each other up, and so you
should get the entries:

Type 2  domain name RICE.EDU  host name RICE.EDU
Type 2  domain name RICE.EDU  host name PENDRAGON.CS.PURDUE.EDU

as well as all three of the addresses you received.  On the other hand,
the entries:

Type 2  domain name PURDUE.EDU  host name PENDRAGON.CS.PURDUE.EDU
Type 2  domain name PURDUE.EDU  host name RICE.EDU

are completely irrelevant, and probably represent a minor bug in the
NIC name server software.  I suspect that it was written with the
implicit assumption that all name servers for a given zone would be in
the same domain.
