Please excuse me if this question is too implementation-specific for this
group, it's the most appropriate forum I have access to, and I know there are a
lot of BIND experts out there...

Background: BIND version 4.8 (altho I've tried the enhanced version from UofT
as well), on mostly SunOS (i.e. BSD Unix) systems. No connection to the
Internet (yet?), but some use of BIND on the internal network, wishing to
increase this usage by making it easy to set up additional servers, possibly
accessed via Yellow Pages (no flames please!:-).

I thought the forwarders + slave functions would be just the thing for this,
i.e. all that should be needed would be a named.boot file with

forwarders addr1 addr2 ...
slave

where addr1 etc would of course indicate more knowledgeable servers. A minimum
of data, no additional files to keep track of, etc.

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work - the server still wants to know of at
least one root server, to be specified in the cache file. Given this, it will
(at startup) as far as I can see check with the forwarder(s) for current root
servers, i.e. it is not critical that the cache file is correct/updated, but it
all seems rather pointless, since this server will never send a request
directly to the root servers.

And the problems don't end with this; although the server is now running fine,
'nslookup' refuses to talk to it. This is apparently because nslookup wants to
find out the server's host name by doing an inverse query with the IP address
as "answer" - this will quite naturally fail unless the server has previously
been asked to look up the IP address for it's host name, which may well never
happen in this scenario. (If nslookup had instead made a PTR query for this, it
would have worked fine.)  Putting the server's host name and IP address in the
cache file doesn't seem to be enough to get around this, and I can't see any
other sensible way of making sure that it has that data (except by making it a
secondary server, of course, which I would prefer not to).

Any and all suggestions on how to get this (i.e. a minimum BIND configuration,
not necessarily the way I tried) to work would be appreciated. Private e-mail
preferred, I will summarize to the list/group if interest warrants.
