Wouldn't it be a good idea for *every* host that can receive mail to
have an MX record in the domain data base?  (Even if there were only
one MX record, pointing to the host itself?)

The reason I suggest this is that -- as far as I can tell -- Sendmail's
domain lookup code asks for MX records on every domain it wants to send
to.  Since there is as yet no standard for "negative caching" (i.e.,
caching of the fact that given data does not exist), multiple attempts
to send mail to a domain name without MX data will result in multiple
vain queries for the non-existent MX data.  This seems very wasteful of
machine and network resources.  Further, if network congestion or other
problems prevents some of these MX queries from getting through, mail
will be held up with server failures, *even* if address (A) records for
the domain name in question exist in the mail sender's cache.

I think most would agree that the ideal solution to this problem would
be the adoption of a suitable "negative caching" scheme in the name
servers.  However, since this is presumably unlikely to happen for some
time, it would seem that the addition of an MX record for *every* domain
name to which mail might be addressed is a reasonable short- to medium-
term solution.

In our domain (UCLA.EDU), every host that might receive mail has an MX
record (or, if appropriate, multiple MX records); a WKS record advertis-
ing at least TCP/SMTP capability; and an A record or records.
