Just a reminder that the SOA field is not sufficient, although it
may be a good start.  There are two fundamental problems.

(1) I don't know of any RFC that requires all TCP/IP hosts supporting
electronic mail to have a user interface command that will query a
nameserver and print out this value.  This suggests that most will
not have such a command.  This means the ordinary user has no way
to get the information.

(2) This one is more serious.  All the world's not the ARPANET.  There
are lots of people who are not on the ARPA Internet and cannot query
the appropriate nameserver to get the information.  There are also lots
of zones which are subzones of parents that are not on the ARPA Internet,
and so have no SOA record in which to place the information.  For example,
if UUCP Zone domain ATT.COM allocates a subdomain cbosgd.ATT.COM, there
is no place on the ARPA Internet where cbosgd.ATT.COM has a nameserver
record whose SOA you can query.  (Nor should there be; the whole point
of the tree structure is that ATT.COM can delegate the administration of
its subdomains as it sees fit, without registering all its internal
details on the Internet.)  ATT.COM, being a UUCP zone domain, has an MX
record that says that all mail for *.ATT.COM gets sent via a mail forwarder.

I think the "domainmaster" idea is a much better fit, although I'd prefer
to see a shorter name.  (System V UNIX has trouble with names longer than
8 characters, and "postmaster" isn't being widely implemented, partly
because it's hard to do on a vanilla system.)  I suggest "registry" as
one possible name, or "domains".

One problem that would have to be solved is that all domains would have
to support mail to them, even if they don't have hosts.  For example,
"domainmaster@com" or "domainmaster@arpa" or "domainmaster@." would
have to somehow be handled.
