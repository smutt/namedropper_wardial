Hi,

The following is a draft of a proposed RFC on DNS records for
domain name to X.25 and ISDN bindings, submitted for your comments,
criticisms, and flames.

The intent is to define the syntax, and first level semantics; then
to experiment with use of the bindings.

The unpublished document on TP/IX is available only in PostScript
at this time; send me mail if you would like a copy; feel free to
redistribute it, but only in its entirety.

With apologies to those subscribers to both NAMEDROPPERS (aka
comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains) and TCP-ISDN ...

Best Regards,
Robert Ullmann

Request for Comments: DRAFT                         Prime Computer, Inc.
                                                               July 1990






              Domain Name System Records for X.25 and ISDN

1. Status of this Memo

This [DRAFT] memo describes an experimental representation of PSDN and
ISDN addresses, in the DNS, as well as a route binding method for very
large scale networks.

This [DRAFT] memo specifies the Internet standard for the definition of
DNS RR types 25, 26, and 27 in the Internet class.

[The use of codes 25 to 27 has NOT been approved by Paul Mockapetris as
of the date of this DRAFT, 30 July 1990]

Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

2. Introduction

This memo specifies new RR types defined for use in the IN (Internet)
class of the DNS [6, 7].  These include addresses for PSDN and ISDN
service, and a new route-binding RR analogous to the MX RR for mail
routing.

There are several possible uses, all experimental at this time.  First,
the RRs provide simple documentation of the correct address(es) to use
in static configurations of IP/X.25 <A NAME="-5"></A><A HREF="#5">[5]</A> and SMTP/X.25 <A NAME="-8"></A><A HREF="#8">[8]</A>.

The RRs could also be used automatically by an internet network-layer
router, typically IP. The procedure would be to map IP address to domain
name, then name to canonical name if needed, then following RT records,
and finally attempting an IP/X.25 call to the address found.
Alternately, configured domain names could be resolved to identify IP to
X.25/ISDN bindings for a static but periodically refreshed routing
table.

This provides a function similar to ARP for wide area non-broadcast
networks that will scale well to a network with hundreds of millions of
hosts.

Also, a standard address binding reference will facilitate other
experiments in the use of X.25 and ISDN, especially in serious
inter-operability testing. (The author knows from experience that the
majority of work in such a test is establishing the n-squared entries in
static tables.)

Finally, the RRs are intended for use in a proposal <A NAME="-9"></A><A HREF="#9">[9]</A> by the author
for a possible next-generation internet.

3. The X25 resource record

The X25 record identifies the PSDN address in the X.121 <A NAME="-4"></A><A HREF="#4">[4]</A> numbering
plan for the domain name. The address is represented as a string of
decimal digits, beginning with the 4 digit DNIC (Data Network
Identification Code).

For example:

    Relay.Prime.COM.   IN   X25       311061700956

The encoded form is the ASCII representation of the decimal digits, as a
&lt;character-string&gt;.  Type X25 is 25.

4. The ISDN resource record

The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) record identifies the
PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) number of the host, together
with any DDI (Direct Dial In) and subaddress (SA) as defined by
E.164 <A NAME="-2"></A><A HREF="#2">[2]</A> and E.163 <A NAME="-1"></A><A HREF="#1">[1]</A>, the ISDN and PSTN numbering plans.

The number is represented as a string of decimal digits, beginning with
the E.163 country code and ending with the DDI if any.  If a SA is
present, it is represented as another string.

For example:

    Relay.Prime.COM.   IN   ISDN      150887929603217
    sh.Prime.COM.      IN   ISDN      150887929603217 004

The RR data is the ASCII representation of the decimal digits.  It is
encoded as one or two &lt;character-string&gt;s, i.e. count followed by
characters.  Type ISDN is 26.

CCITT recommendation E.166 <A NAME="-3"></A><A HREF="#3">[3]</A> defines escape codes for the
representation of ISDN addresses in X.121, and PSDN addresses in E.164.
It specifies that the exact codes are a "national matter", i.e.
different on different networks. An ISDN host may be able to use both
the X25 and ISDN addresses, with local information added, but the
addresses must be distinct in the DNS.

5. The RT resource record

The RT resource record provides a route-through binding for hosts that
do not have their own direct wide area network addresses. It is used in
much the same way as the MX RR.

The format is one (usually small) integer, representing the preference

Ullmann                                                         [Page 2]

of the route. Smaller numbers indicate more preferred routes. This is
followed by the domain name of the host to route through, which is
expected to have at least one A, X25, or ISDN record.

For example,

    sh.prime.com.      IN   RT   2    Relay.Prime.COM.
                       IN   RT   10   NET.Prime.COM.
    *.prime.com.       IN   RT   90   Relay.Prime.COM.

When a host is looking up DNS records to attempt to route a datagram, it
first looks for RT records for the destination host, which point to
hosts with address records (A, X25, ISDN) compatible with the wide area
networks available to the host. If it is itself in the set of RT
records, it discards any RTs with preferences higher or equal to its
own.  If there are no (remaining) RTs, it can then use address records
of the destination itself.

Wild-card RTs are used exactly as are wild-card MXs.

The concrete encoding is identical to the MX RR.  Type RT is 27.
