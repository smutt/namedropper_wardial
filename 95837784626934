SRI-NIC Hostmaster:

   There is a CNAME entry for LOGNET2.ARPA pointing to LOGNET2.AF.MIL.
However, LOGNET2.AF.MIL is not resolved by all the root servers equally.
Perhaps it is just a temporary glitch but rather frustrating.

   Connectivity was rather poor when I tried, but negative replies for
LOGNET2.AF.MIl were returned by C.NYSER.NET and TERP.UMD.EDU.  The
rest either resolved the name or could not be reached.

   There has been talk of a BARRNET/NSFNET connection for SRI-NIC which
would make it much more accessible to the root servers on NSFNET and user
and host systems!  Is that being worked on?  This is the 2nd time in a
week that I have been affected by a discrepency like this...  ;-)

   It would seem that improving the connectivity should help keep the
root servers in something less than one week synchronization (C.Nyser.NET
was a few days old and TERP.UMD.EDU at 890602).  Certainly the people who
run the root servers are probably very busy and shouldn't have to take
manual intervention all the time.

   I am not familiar with how the root server base developed, but is there
some sort of combined effort to upgrade the software and connectivity
among the servers?

Howdy!
      This question may be rather broad, but as I am new to this list and to
this field of study, I thought I'd try it :

      Can anyone suggest some good sources for tracing the roots of one's
      family in Ireland?  We have some relatives who have provided a great
      deal of information, but some items come to an abrupt dead-end.  Is there
      a definitve anthology of family historys for that country?

The two surnames we are trying to trace are BRADLEY and KINSELLA.  Any
information of such sources or commenst that may point us in the correct
direction will be greatly appreciated.
