	Re: insisting on inverse mappings:

	Hmm, I'm interested in this discussion, having just been involved in
	an argument with a site that refuses connections to sites that won't
	inverse map.  Can someone quote chapter and verse from an RFC that
	says that a host's IP address should inverse map via DNS before it can
	make a connection?  All I can find that seems relevant is from Host
	Requirements II, RFC 1123:

	   2.2  Using Domain Name Service

	      Host domain names MUST be translated to IP addresses as described
	      in Section 6.1.

	      Applications using domain name services MUST be able to cope with
	      soft error conditions.  Applications MUST wait a reasonable
	      interval between successive retries due to a soft error, and MUST
	      allow for the possibility that network problems may deny service
	      for hours or even days.

	Do these systems that reject connections based on no inverse mapping
	allow for this sort of error?

	I guess the philosophy puzzles me.  I've always thought of DNS as a
	way of making it easier for clients to connect to services, not as any
	sort of authentication system.

	At this site we have 2000 machines on LocalTalk networks using dynamic
	IP address assignment and supporting no IP services.  Is it really
	necessary for security for us to give them all names (actually, give
	the addresses names) and put them in our domain database?  Surely if
	intrusive activity is coming from one of these machines it's easy to
	determine where it's at by looking at the network part of its IP
	address?

Bob,

Just to keep the record straight: this issue about requiring inverse
mappings never came up in the HR WG deliberations, and I don't think
the words you qoute are relevant to this case.   I will make a note of
it for a future revision of the HR RFCs... once you guys decide what
the right answer is, of course!
