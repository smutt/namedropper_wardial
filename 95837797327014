	...
	The solutions based on "distance" combine the MX "preference indicator"
	with a local preference attached to the relay host, and attempt to sort
	the relays on the sum of "MX preference" plus "local preference".

I think it should be a product, not a sum, but that is a very minor point.
Also, "local preference" could be a policy-based routing metric.  It is
agreed that hosts should not participate in routing decisions, but on the
other hand hosts should be able to know the cost associated with one route
versus another (perhaps in a uniform, normalized, protocol-independent
fashion, by asking a "route-server").

	Bruce's suggestion is a variation on that scheme, with a local
	preference function taking the value "0" (when the destination can be
	reached) or "infinite" (when unreachable). It is in fact very hard to go
	much further with the current scheme, as the preference indicators dont
	qualify as "distances"; nothing prevent some domain to allocate the
	preferences as "0:here, 1:nearby, 5:far-away", and some others to use
	"0:here, 10:same-campus, 20:same-region, 50:same-country"...

First, it isn't important that they have magnitude, but just that they
be ordered.  But, if you really want to give them magnitude, you can
normalize them using the smallest number as the origin (ie. subtract
this) and the largest number as the unit distance (ie. then divide by
[largest - smallest]).  Of course, this will yield a real number between
0 and 1, so all you systems programmers out there will have to get used
to using floating point numbers, or at least scale it by 1000 (but I
digress...).

	*QUESTION: would it be possible to transform the MX so that they
	indicate a real "distance"? This would in particular make the "grouping"
	of transatlantic mail much more efficient.

It all depends on what this distance is measured in, from where, and
whether it is linear, cartesian, etc.

	The solution implemented in Germany is based on "visibility". The idea
	is that some informations are visible only within some domains. For
	example, the FR domain contains some commercial subnets which are
	connected to the French infrastructure, but are not allowed to use the
	NSFNET; listing their sites in the MX records would be very helpful in
	France, but would be very unfriendly to our US partners, which will get

Why is it unfriendly?  It just means that the mail sits in their queue
an extra 2 minutes while destination unreachables get returned from the
primary MXer (or in our case, the initial SYNs fall into a black-hole).

	the info (MX, A, etc), but will see their connection attempts fail
	because "this net is unreachable". The dumb systems will sit there and
	fail; the smarter will apply the strategy defined by Bruce; all will

I have no sympathy for sites that do not try every MX host (or indeed,
don't have MX capability).  Why make it easier for them to get by with
non-compliance?

	somewhat suffer. [ ... ]

	The class field was originally inserted for taking care of different
	networks, e.g. IP and CHAOS. One could probably use it for defining
	visibility rules, e.g. "get an MX record in the German class for domain
	xxx.de" vs "get an MX record in the INTERNET class for domain xxx.de"
	(or in the European class for the fringes). Bringing different answer,
	e.g. the target host in one case, the German gateway in another, would
	be perfectly reasonable. 

To quote another German [Goebels], "When someone starts talking about
changing deployed protocols, I reach for my gun."  I don't think this
is a good idea.  As for your above scenario with MX records, consider
the following:

I, the message sender, might be at a site with fairly good connectivity.
It is possible that when I do an MX query, and have several answers
returned to me, I might have multiple paths available to me.  Which path
I take can be quite involved:  If I am a visiting researcher (say on my
post-doc year) at IBM T.J. Watson and jointly on a NSF grant, I might
want my mail to exit the IBM internet immediately, traverse the NSFnet,
cross the Atlantic, and go to the German relay; if it is unreachable,
to go via NSFnet-based relay (which may have its own connections).

On the other hand, if I am an IBM employee (possibly also at Yorktown),
then it might be better to have the mail traverse the IBM internal
internet, and exit in Zurich for the most preferred MX host.  The
reasons for this might be: privacy, delay, or desire to use your own
resources rather than someone else's [!!].
	
So, distance is a measure (by whatever metric) between two points.  But
with rich connectivity, you can be at several points at once.  So, it
isn't all that simple...
