I'm delighted to see the response my message received. I want to
say a few things about what we're doing, and for that matter, who
"we" are.

The task force I referred to is the naming task force of the Distributed
Systems Architecture Board (DSAB); a sister organization of the IAB.
(In practice, it turns out we're a pseudo task force of the IAB as well.)
In addition to myself, other board members include Karen Sollins (MIT),
Dave Presotto (Bell Labs), John Zahorjan (Washington), Mike Davis (SRI),
Craig Partrige (BBN), and Paul Mockapetris (you all know Paul). Several
other people, too numerous to mention, have also participated in e-mail
discussions. Karen and I are currently writing the RFC, which specifies 
an architecture and protocol loosely based on a prototype designed, 
implemented, and evaluated as part of the Profile project at Arizona. 
That project is/will be funded by NSF and NASA. In the next three years 
we plan to turn the protoype into "working" system and make it available 
to the internet community.

By the way, we are aware of the CCITT/ISO effort, but so far have only
sketchy details about what they're doing. (I'd be happy to receive 
anything written down about X.500, etc.)

I used the wrong word when I said "*many* of the technical problems have
been solved". I should have said *enough* of them have been solved to lead 
us to believe two things: (1) we understand what the basic architecture
should look like, and (2) we can build a system that, while it can be
extened, will provide a valuable service to the internet. One of the
most challenging problems that remains (as pointed out by a couple of
the responses) is how to partition the attribute space into a hierarchy 
of name servers. Our answer is that the partitioning should be allowed to
evolve in a "natural" and "unspecified" way. That is, multiple hierarchies
of name servers will grow from the leaves up. The architecture will not
mandate a particular top-down growth as was done in the DNS. This pushes
the problem onto the "search strategy" used by a given client to walk
through the "confederation of name servers". A good analogy is to view the
collection of loosely coupled name servers (they are at least weakly coupled
in the sense that one of the objects named by a given name server might
be another name server) as a library reference collection. The search
discipline is the "librarian" that uses heuristics to search the reference
collection. We believe, there will exist well-recongized hierarchies within
the confederation.
