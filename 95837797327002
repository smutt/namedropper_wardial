     This is another instance of the "the answer depends on who is
asking" issue.  It has come up before with a desire to keep certain
clients confidential and a desire to avoid extra cross-Atlantic
hops in mail messages and a desire to select the BITNET gateway
closest to the sender (or the receiver).

     The traditional approach of the domain system has been that
every requestor gets the same answer.  This approach simplifies
caching.  If answers depended on the requestor,  caches would have
to be maintained in the form of requestor-answer pairs.  (Of course
the requestor part could be in the form of large groups of
requestors.)  The administrators of the .DE zone have attempted to
avoid this problem by having separate servers to server the two
parts of the world and hoping a requestor never gets an answer that
originated in the wrong part of the world.

     Here is a solution to the .DE problem that is consistent with
the traditional approach:

1.  There is one version of the .DE zone that is seen by everyone. 
The zone includes A records for all the nodes that have internet
addresses, regardless of from where that address is reachable.  The
zone also includes MX records as follows: (1) For nodes with
internet addresses, an MX record pointing to the node itself; (2)
For all nodes, gateways that are generally reachable such as
MCSUN.EU.NET and RELAY.CS.NET.

2.  Each node applies its own evaluation to the MX records when
sending a message according to these MX records.  For example, a
node in Europe could drop all the MX records in North America.  In
addition, a record of past connection attempts could be kept.  A
node that could not be reached could be blacklisted for a while (a
week, perhaps).  Some provision would have to be made for the case
where all the MX's get dropped.  This is a slight departure from
the ordering of MX records given in RFC 974 in that it may result
in a node with a higher (worse) MX preference getting tried before
all the nodes with lower preferences were tried.

     The same solution can be applied to the Atlantic-crossing
problem in general (it came up before for DEC.COM from France).
