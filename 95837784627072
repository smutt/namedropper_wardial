&gt;The Host Requirements RFC 1123 strongly suggests such locally
&gt;configured information for ordering alternate addresses (section 6.1.3.4
&gt;of RFC-1123), to be included in the name-&gt;host transformation provided
&gt;by the DNS client program.  [I would not called that a "session layer"
&gt;function, but oerhaps there is no other obvious place to put it in
&gt;the ISO model].

As long as the OSI model is concerned, this is definitely a transport
function -- or a routing function. Its need derives from the practice
of allocating several IP addresses to an host, e.g. one per interface
in BSD implementations; in principle, having several network interfaces
is not considered a good reason for allocating several NSAP addresses
in the ISO networks. Requesting the application to sort network
addresses by using a magic metric is questionable at best...

The case of the mail routing is different, for the very purpose of the
application is to apply relaying of messages. One could expect that
intelligent mail routers will acquire somehow a knowledge of the "mail
network" topology, and use that for choosing the best destination.
After all, this is exactly what the UUCP mailer do!

The real problem is thus "how to express the network topology". The
current solution (MX records) is probably not sophisticated enough; we
need to give more data than just a relay and a cost, e.g. the fact that
such destination belongs to such autonomous network. In order to get
convinced, just try to devise a routing strategy which will send a
single copy of a message from the US to say France, if the message has
several recipients in France, on different hosts, all reachable with MX
and A records in the DNS.
