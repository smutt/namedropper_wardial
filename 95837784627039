A month or two ago while using some equipment which watches packets on
our ethernet I noticed packets coming from address 127.0.0.1 from one
of the Unix machines on our network.  The packets were being sent to
UDP port 53 on three different machines in the lab.  They were all
from the same ethernet address which was a particular unix machine.
Since there was only this one Unix machine doing this I looked around
on this Unix to try and see what was different about it.

It seems that someone had changed /etc/resolv.conf on this machine from

	LCS.MIT.EDU
	127.0.0.1
	domain LCS.MIT.EDU
	nameserver 127.0.0.1

to

	LCS.MIT.EDU
	127.0.0.1
	domain LCS.MIT.EDU
	nameserver 127.0.0.1
	nameserver 18.26.0.115
	nameserver 18.30.0.33
	nameserver 18.26.0.90

on the theory that with this change the mailer on this machine could
continue to run despite named dumping core.

I didn't examine the libc stub-resolver code in detail, so I'm not
exactly sure what causes the packets from 127.0.0.1, but deleting the
last three "nameserver" lines above (which restored the file to its
original contents) stopped the packets from 127.0.0.1.

Maybe the libc stub resolver uses the same UDP socket to send requests
to each of the name servers and since it sends to 127.0.0.1 first
which gets routed through Unix's loopback interface the from address
of the socket gets bound to 127.0.0.1.  Then later when it sends to
the other IP addresses, the kernel continues to use the same from IP
address on the socket.  (This is just a theory.)

If you are seeing packets at root domain servers from IP address
127.0.0.1 then I suspect some people are confused about what should be
going in /etc/resolv.conf on Unix machines.
