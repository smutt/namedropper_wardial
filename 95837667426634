    I'm currently working on a short RFC describing how mailers should
handle the problems of MF and MD records (I'd also like to deal with
mailbox stuff but that looks like it requires much more detailed thought
and I like to get the MF and MD stuff out the door while people are
still in the process of changing their mailers for domains).  Anyway,
as a result I was re-reading RFC 882 and noticed on page 19 that wildcard
name matching is supported.  Yes, you can set up a domain like Israel
and say forward all mail to .il to relay.cs.net. In fact, it even
permits you to use wildcards as defaults (if you don't match on
the hostname, you try for a wildcard match).

    After reading this section I had a few questions:

    1.  Why wasn't it mentioned in early debates on wildcarding?
    Is there some consensus that this feature shouldn't be used?

    2.  Is there any good reason why stars (*) can't replace
    dots (.) in the wildcarding?  When you replace
    the left-most label with a star, why not replace the left-most
    label and its concluding dot with the star?  I've
    yet to think of a scenario where this causes problems, and
    believe it is unfortunate that to make sure I match all
    names in a given domain that I have to list  *.domain,
    *.*.domain, *.*.*.domain, *.*.*.*.domain (etc.).  This
    ignoring the fact that, of course, some day there will
    be a domain name with more labels than I bothered to
    wildcard.

    3. The RFC only bans '*' in TYPE and CLASS fields.  It seems
    to me this is a bit conservative.  I'd like to suggest
    we ban it in the RDATA fields, or at least in RDATA fields
    of mail RR's.  I don't think it makes much sense to hand
    a mailer an RR which reads, for example:

	LOKI.BBN.COM	IN 	MF     *.BBN.COM

	or

	LOKI.BBN.COM	IN	MD	*.COM

    What would this mean?  Why would we want to say it?

    Happy to be corrected.
