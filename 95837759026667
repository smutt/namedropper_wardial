Well, I guess I was right about MX records being useless for "inter-internet"
mail routing.  J. Spenser Love points out that the weight on an MX
record COULD be interpreted as the weight of the cheapest path from the
relay to the destination, notes that that information, by itself, is
insufficient to solve the routing problem, and attempts to supply the
missing information.  I would point out that he doesn't really address
the problem of multi-hop interinternet routing (in which the source and
destination mail systems are not directly connected), unless it is
to be presumed that different mail systems have different name server
data bases.  Jon Postel drives the final nail in the coffin by informing us
that interpretating the MX weight as a path length is contrary to the
intention of the spec.

I guess that leaves us with a bona fide RESEARCH problem:  how to do
interinternet mail routing.  Maybe the domain name system is a totally
inappropriate tool for the problem.  If so, maybe this discussion
should be moved to a different list (msggroup?  header-people? I can
never remember which is which).  Maybe this isn't even a problem of
interest to the DARPA Internet community.  If you believe that
eventually Arpanet users will be able to route IP datagrams to any mail
destination they wish to communicate with, then the problem will go
away.

I think the interinternet mail routing problem is of interest to the Internet,
and the domain name server can help.  In my previous message, I listed the
minimal set of facts needed by the source mailer:  The mail systems containing
the source and destination hosts and the set of mail relays in the universe
(together with the set of mail systems served by each one).  The latter
table (of mail systems and the relays connecting them) is, for the forseeable
future, a relatively small and slowly-changing database.  It would probably
be adequate to maintain it by hand, although it might me nice to put
it into the name server database.  That still leaves the requirement of
a mapping from ALL mail destinations to mail systems.   Maybe the CLASS
field could be used for that.  I never really understood what the CLASS
was supposed to mean, and I guess nobody else does, since I've never heard
of any class other than IN being used.  Let me suggest for a moment that
CLASS be considered synonymous with what I've been calling "mail system".
Thus the record
	CSNET-RELAY.ARPA  A  IN  10.4.0.5
means that CSNET-RELAY is in the Arpa Internet mail system and can be reached
from elsewhere in that mail system by sending IP datagrams to 10.4.0.5.
The record
	WISCVM.WISC.EDU  A  BITNET  WISCVM
means that WISCVM is in the BITNET mail system.  (In BITNET, the host
name serves pretty much as an address).
The record
	HOOPLE.UNSD.SD.EDU  A  CSNET 1-800-555-1212
would indicate that HOOPLE is in CSNET (more precisely, PhoneNet) and
has a dialup at the phone number indicated.  (Actually, it might be
more realistic to list every CSNET record as
	FOO.BAR.GLARCH  A  CSNET  FOO.BAR.GLARCH
since as far as anybody but CSNET-RELAY is concerned, the name of a
PhoneNet host is its address).

Assuming such records, and assuming that there is a table that lists
all mail systems and how they are connected, the routing algorithm
is straight-forward:
	1. Use MX records to find the actual mail destination.
	2. Find all 'A' records (in any class) for the source and destination.
	3. If there is any class that contains records for both the source
	   and destination, we are done:  Send the mail using mechanisms
	   appropriate to the indicated mail system.
	4. Otherwise, use the mail-system graph to find a path
		MS0 -&gt; Relay1 -&gt; MS1 -&gt; ... -&gt; MSn-1 -&gt; Relayn -&gt; MSn
	   where the source is in mail system MS0 and the destination is in MSn.

While this algorithm is adequate, it doesn't take into account cost
(and as I pointed out before, cost is important not only for efficiency,
but to assure that everyone makes the same decisions, thus preventing loops).
But this message is already much too long, so I'll leave the discussion of
minimal cost routing for another day.
