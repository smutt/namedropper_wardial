Sorry to bring the issue of address selection up again, but I was away
last time around.  We are currently testing a scheme similar to one
described by several respondents at Berkeley now.  In the resolver,
before returning the results of an address query with multiple
addresses, the addresses are reordered if any of them is detectably
"better" than the others.  Although this is conceptually within
the resolver, it occurs within the long-lived name server, but only
for local queries.  The configuration information is obtained from
the local network information and from a configuration file.  The
ranking is

	1. an address on a shared network
	2. an address on another subnet of a local subnetted network
	3. an address on a short list of preferred networks
	   (e.g. at Berkeley, Arpanet and networks to which we have
	   private links)
	4. none of the above

So far we find this to work well, and it makes things work "properly"
under many adverse circumstances such as failed gateways.  There is
also a sizable performance improvement in some cases.

I would resist using other, more heuristic, criteria for sorting
addresses.  In general, without good reason for reordering resource
records, their order should be preserved.

I must also respond to the following comments from Andrew Scott Beals
&lt;bandy@lll-crg.arpa&gt;:

	Unfortunately, the Berklix software doesn't try all the alternate
	addresses listed in the host table if one set doesn't work.  For that
	matter, nor does it try other routes if one router is down.  Boo hiss.

Using the host table on 4.<A NAME="-23"></A><A HREF="#23">[23]</A>BSD, there is only one address listed
per host (unless there are multiple lines, possibly duplicates),
and the user interface to name translation returns the one
address from that line.  Using the name server with 4.3, all of the
addresses are returned.  Most of the network programs (telnet, ftp,
rlogin, rsh etc) will try each address in turn.  Again, it's a win
to try the closest/most efficient first, as it's also most likely
to be reachable.

The standard routing software supplied with Berkeley Unix (routed)
changes routing dynamically when things change.  If you're not using
routed or other dynamic routing, then don't complain when your
routing isn't updated when routers are down.
