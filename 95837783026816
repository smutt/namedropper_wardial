I don't know if I represent any large fraction of the Internet developers,
or the maintainers of portions of it, but I don't think your proposal will
make my life easier.  I am not criticizing the mechanism (I've never worked
on the protocol), but rather the result you want.

I like the domain system.  Where it is implemented, the PTR query lets me
identify hosts who are:

1. Accessing machines I maintain, via anonymous FTP, for instance. (my
   network maintainer hat).

2. Generating interesting or bogus packets (my developer/tester hat).

The HINFO query gives me even more useful information.

I don't like being hindered from using my tools to identify machines which
participate in the Internet, for the following reasons:

If I encountered an attempt to probe my machine originating from a large
domain which had implemented this sort of restriction, I might well be
pretty irate by the time I located (via 'nicname' and telephone) an individual
who could identify the hidden machine, and suppress the prober.

If I encountered bogus behaviour that I thought a fix existed for (what
looked like early 4.3 TCP problems, or a gateway acting up, for instance),
I might find it hard enough to locate and identify a responsible person
that I might not bother (particularly if I couldn't tell what kind of
machine it actually was).

If I encountered aggressively bogus behaviour from a hidden machine, and
it was not possible to locate a responsible individual, I would have two
choices:  Disconnect from the Internet myself, or get out the programs
that send IP packets with odd options, ICMP redirects, etc.

I presume that one of the reasons you want to keep machines private is
deficient security on them.  I submit that the effort would be better
spent on improving either the general security of TCP/IP protocols (for
instance, by implementing Kerberos, or something like it), or the specific
machines involved.  Your other reason, maintaining mutual secrecy among
commercial clients, seems to me to be fundamentally flawed if the
customer's network number is registered, and the hosts on that network
actually participate in the Internet.  If so, anyone equipped who can
read EGP packets can see the connectivity.  Anyone with a PING which
can do IP source route/record route can find it, too.

If the customer networks don't participate, and your gateways don't pass
packets for them, I'll never see bogus behaviour, so that issue is moot.
I still have a decent chance of noticing one of your gateways failing,
or a cracker who has discovered he can get onto the Internet via your
terminal server...

Our DOS product can do PTR queries right now, and HINFO queries and fancy
IP options for PING are not too far away.

These are solely my own opinions.
