For what it's worth, your interpretations sound reasonable to me.  I think
you get to decide for yourself whether you can embed your mailbox handling
semantics in the MB/MG world, and yet function properly with mail sending
agents that don't consult MB/MG in sending mail.  If you can't do that
embedding, then you might as well keep all your mailbox handling semantics
private, and don't publish it with MB/MG.

Perhaps your problem (two levels of mailbox names, the widely-known and
guessable, vs. the locally-known forwarding destination) is similar to the
one we had, where we wanted to separate out the userid and full-name name
spaces for local mail addressing.  That is, we didn't want the fact that
there was a local userid ``smith'' to occlude the ambiguity that we thought
should result from a mail address (``smith@andrew.cmu.edu'') that somebody
just guessed, when there are several people with the surname Smith who have
Andrew accounts.  Our solution was to tag userid-form local-parts with a
plus character (so that ``smith+@andrew.cmu.edu'' wouldn't be ambiguous) and
interpret naive-looking name probes heuristically (so, say,
``Zachariah.Smith@andrew.cmu.edu'' is probably unambiguous, but
``smith@andrew.cmu.edu'' is ambiguous if there's more than one Smith on the
system, even if only one of them (or somebody else) has userid ``smith'').

Another simple view of the situation is that the unadorned local-part is a
request for a name lookup, whereas the local-part that includes the plus
character is the result of the name lookup.

That's my K cents on handling two levels of name spaces for local mail
addresses.
