&gt; I have a strategy question for this group (at least, it seems the best match).
&gt; It concerns mail addressing in a world that is still only partially converted
&gt; to the name-domain system.

&gt; for ucbvax in the host table.)  Using these return addresses has become
&gt; less and less desirable, in part because poor ucbvax (a VAX 11/750) has

On the other hand, it does have the advantage of at least getting the
mail "on campus" instead of sitting in someones queue across the country.

&gt; We are debating dropping the rewrite and using our domain names exclusively.
&gt; Of course, this means that Milnet sites that have not converted will be

&gt;From what I can tell, there's also a whole lot of non-Milnet hosts that
don't yet have access to the domain system (HP, Apollo, NBI, Wang, et al)

&gt; How are other sites addressing these issues?  My personal inclination
&gt; is "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"-- we should ignore the problems
&gt; of hosttable-only sites and put the compatibility burden on them,

What we're trying to do here is move toward departmental mail servers.
I.e.  the only "names" that will appear in the host tables are of the
"dept.wisc.edu" form.  One of the really hard problems here is getting
the return addresses to be generated in this form.  There are an awful
lot of folks without sendmail and without even Unix, you know.

I understand that the "full speed ahead" approach may indeed put some
pressure on some vendors.  On the other hand, it's adopting what seems
to me to be somewhat of a snobbish attitude; i.e., if you don't have
the "right stuff", you don't deserve to talk to us.
