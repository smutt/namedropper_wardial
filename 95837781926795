There were a number of knotty technical problems involved in this issue,
including SATNET, EGP, BIND, core gateways, etc., but there is a policy
issue that I think bears discussion.

What is acceptable behaviour by servers which are supposed to be
authoritative for a domain?

A server which is supposed to be authoritative for some domain may not
be able to get the data.  Like it or not, head crashes, network failure,
etc happen.  Such a server should not give authoritative answers for the
missing domain, but should behave as if it never heard of the domain.
If it did have the parent domain, it might respond to clients by a
delegation that pointed to itself (among other servers).  Neither the
client nor the name server should self-destruct in this circumstance.

Suppose I have an old, damaged, partial, etc master file.  Should I go
with it knowing that I may blow up some users and save others?

My bias is to say that you shouldn't go with it.  All mail getting
requeued is better than some going and other stuff getting tossed, but
that's my bias and others may disagree.  On the other hand, the
distributed control structure of the Domain system means that
administrators will occasionaly have to follow local pressure.  This was
an issue in the cs.ucl.ac.uk case.

Who do I complain to?

Look at the SOA.  It has a responsible person mailbox.  Someone is
supposed to be there.  In the cs.ucl.ac.uk case this turned out to be
postmaster@cs.ucl.ac.uk - not very helpful.  This is an inexcusable bug
in the domain.

Given the distributed management style of the domain system, I'd suggest
the following steps when an inexcusable problem occurs:

1) Complain privately to the responsible person for the domain.

2) Complain publicly to the responsible person for the domain.

3) Ask the NIC for the administrative person for the domain.  Complain.

4) Complain to the parent authorities.

5) Ask the parent authorities to excommunicate the domain.

Your style may differ.  Maybe we need a definition of domain capital crimes?
