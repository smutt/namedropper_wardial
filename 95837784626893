Christian,

How many codes does Peoples Republic of China get? Do we tell Luxembourg
they have to apply for a class-C code? What code to I use to message the
deejay at pirate Radio Caroline? A more serious and interesting example is
to trace the evolution in CCIR radio callsigns assigned over the last
35 years I have been talking with amateur radio stations all over the world.
The CCIR started out with callsign prefixes more or less rationally assigned,
but this was in the days of colonialism, so that large blocks of alphabetic
prefixes were assigned the UK (all the G space), France (all the F space)
and US (all the A, K, N and W space). Over the years of various wars,
revolutions and political realignment various hunks of these spaces departed
and demanded their own private space untainted by the alphabetic tyranny of
their former space. FOr instance, various Z's of the UK colonial space were
ripped away and became C5As and other unpronouncables. The space is so 
fragmented now that any political affiliative infomation you might get
from the radio callsign is marginal. It used to be you could determine
which in which country a movie was shot by looking at the aircraft
identification number, which is also its radio callsign. Now you need to
carry a decoding book.

I see nothing to refute my suspicion that organization codes will grow 
and fragment in exactly the same way.
