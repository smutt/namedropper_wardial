The issue raised in Mark's message concerning the different
characterisitics of the ARPA internet and the UUCP net are very
important.  IFIP WG 6.5, which has been discussing mailing and directory
issues for some time has developed a vocabulary for discussing these
issues.  DIRECT directory access is the style assumed in the design of
the domain system.  In this scheme, the sender establishes direct
connection with successive directories until a name is resolved.  By
assumption, resolving the name provides enough information to construct
a route to the destination, and the message is then sent off.

	
INDIRECT directory access has each directory establish contact with the
next level of directory in order to resolve a name.  When the name is
resolved, this is sent back through the chain of directories to the
message originator.  This scheme is attractive when directories may be
on the same network but users have to set up a special connection (e.g.
use UUCP mail) to make contact with the first directory.  The DIRECT
scheme is clearly unattractive when connections of a message originator
to a directory are slow.

	
Finally, there is the notion of INCREMENTAL address resolution.  In this
scheme, rather than forwarding an address resoltuion query to successive
directories, the ENTIRE MESSAGE is forwarded at each stage.  The
directory/message router than determines where to send it next in order
to attempt to decode the name.  This scheme mixes name-to-address
resolution with message routing.  If messages are on average short, than
it makes little sense to send a sequence of messages all over the
country to reolve the name, followed by a short message sent once the
name is resolved.  If directories and message routers tend to be
colocated, the path will be traversed twice-- once by the directory
queries and once by the message.  By contrast, if messages tend to be
long, and if routers and directory services are not co-located, then
resolving the name with a series of short messages may allow a long
message to be sent by a direct route to the destination, thus saving on
overall character traffic.

	
In short, the best solution -- DIRECT vs INDIRECT directory queries, and
DIRECT vs INCREMENTAL routing -- depend greatly on the assumptions about
how difficult it is to connect to a directory, and how long messages are
on average.

	
As Mark points out, the answer to these questions is different for UUCP
and for the ARPANET.  Thus, it is logical that the ideal naming and
directory strategy might need to be different in the two cases.
Unfortuantely, using a different strategy confuses the user,
particularly if the user wants to send to destinations on either
network.  Thus, a compromise is in order.  In the nature of things,
however, ARPA has the money and the administrative structure, so domain
names have been designed around the assumption of DIRECT directory
contact, and UUCP is obliged to follow because it has nether the money
nor administrative resources at the present time to do differently.
(This could change if AT&amp;T decides to invest in UUCP in a big way).



In short, I see the desire for hosts to have more than one domain name
-- one which is best for users who can direct connect, and one for users
who cannot easily direct connect and who expect to use incremental
routing/name resoultion -- a reasonable compromise, as long as the rules
of domain name construction are obeyed.  Users need only deal with one
STYLE of name, even if the way that name is decoded (incrementally vs
direct) may be different in the two networks.
