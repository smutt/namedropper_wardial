The UCLA CS Department has now switched over to the use of its new
domain-style host names (LOCUS.UCLA.EDU and ATS.UCLA.EDU) in the return
addresses of outgoing mail.  We are still using the NIC host name table
for name-&gt;address mapping, but we expect to have converted to the dis-
tributed domain data base by summer's end.

As soon as we started using the new names in our outgoing mail, I
started contacting the maintainers of various mailing lists which send
us their stuff, asking them to change their lists to start using our
new domain-style names.  Since the domain names have been listed in the
NIC host name table for several months now, I assumed that any host
whose maintainers have picked up a new NIC table sometime within the
last couple of months (!) should be able to send mail to LOCUS.UCLA.EDU
irrespective of whether or not the other host was using the distributed
data base yet.

How could I have been so incredibly naive :-{ . . . .

Yep, sure enough, I've already gotten a handful of replies from various
and sundry locations indicating that they must (regretfully perhaps)
continue to call us UCLA-LOCUS.ARPA for the time being -- because one
aspect or another of their mail software refuses to cope with the name
LOCUS.UCLA.EDU.

I'm not going to post a list of hosts here, because I've only gotten
back two or three such replies so far.  And, in at least one case, it
wasn't clear whether the list maintainer involved was telling me that
his software choked on the new names, even though they were in the host
name table -- or that his host didn't have an up-to-date host name table
-- or that he just assumed (albeit mistakenly) that his host could not
handle domain names because it was still using the host name table
rather than the domain data base!

In any case, I guess I'll have to get ready for the inevitable set of
requests from our local users that we should change back to the old
names -- for the sake of mail stability -- until such time as everyone
else on the net is able to handle the new naming scheme.  (Of course,
this is no solution at all; if everyone switched back until everyone
else was ready, then no one would have any incentive to fix their mail
systems to handle the new names.)

I don't currently plan to switch back, of course -- and I'm pretty sure
I can probably hold off the tide of contrary opinion -- but if you do
start seeing mail from "wales@UCLA-LOCUS.ARPA" again, you'll know why.
