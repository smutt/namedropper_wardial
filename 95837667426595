I am relatively new to the whole Internet (and beyond) scheme, but I have
noticed something from talking to people at ISI (like Jon...), and watching
discussions on the various mailing lists.

Some time ago, it seems that the domain scheme was adapted to reflect
organization structure.  Any time someone suggests that the domain part
of an address be used to reflect something route-ish or geographical,
the suggestion is denied in favor of the "organizational rule".

Apparently, route/geographical suggestions are on the rise.  In fact, a
couple discussions on this list indicate that only the US considers
"organization" preferrable.

It should also be noted that there seems to be a lot of disagreement/
disgruntlement regarding that various rules of arganizational domaining.
Several discussions seem to be based on "can I do this" or "why can't I
do that".

In my opinion, it is easier for me to remember that a message destined to
somewhere such as UDEL, or a foreign net like BITNET, or whatever has
to follow some geographical or relay path.  I don't ever think I could
remember EDU, COM, or whatever (see, I don't remember).  In fact, I am
involved in a couple of projects where route/geographical interpretation
would lead to nicer (not necessarily lazier) implementations.

(Stand by for heresy...)
I think that the "organizational" rules should be relaxed, or even punted
in favor of route/geographical interpretations.
