In the course of debugging my resolver, I have found that a number of
servers are responding in ways that range from mildly distasteful to
downright antisocial.  I realize that the organizations running the
servers may be mere accesories and not directly to blame, but rather the
server writers or those who compose vague domain specs.  Hence, I
appologize to the named ones, particularly those who have fixed the
problems already.

The top ten:

1) The serial field of the SOA RR for a domain is supposed to be a
continuously increasing (mod 2**32) value which denotes the version of
the database.  The idea is that you can tell that a zone has changed by
comparing serial numbers.

Suspects: I haven't found any values greater than 1, which either means
that we have seen remarkable stability, or else that nobody is playing
the game by the rules.

2) If a node has a CNAME RR, it isn't supposed to have any other RRs.
This makes reasonable caching possible.

Suspects: Too numerous to mention.

3) If you send a query to a host with multiple addresses, it is supposed
to respond from the address receiving the query.

Suspects: Several, but RICE.EDU is the most interesting.  If you ask the
NIC for RICE.EDU, it says that servers are RICE.EDU at 192.5.58.6 and
PENDRAGON.PURDUE.EDU at 192.5.48.5. Fine.  Ask RICE.EDU, using
192.5.58.6, for all information for RICE.EDU, and you get a message back
from 128.42.3.2.  This address doesn't correspond to either data at
RICE.EDU or the delegation from the root servers such as the NIC.

4) If you use the IN-ADDR tree to get a host name corresponding to a
Internet address, you are supposed to get a pointer (PTR) RR to the
primary name of the host, not a list of aliases or whatever.

Suspects: Several, for example the mysterious 128.42.3.2 from the
previous item.

5) Making up data.  For example, there are lots of servers who return
RRs for the root servers with 99999999 in the TTL.  Some return RRs that
suggest that ISIF is a root server.  (It was months ago, but is no
longer.  I use it for testing.  I haven't updated its database since I
started using it for testing.)

One of the main ideas of the domain system is that everybody can get a
chunk of the name space to manage as they choose.  However, you aren't
supposed to lie about other parts of the name space.  Its OK to remember
about other parts of the name space for caching or other purposes, but
you are supposed to follow the TTL rules.


Now it may be that you put such records in your server or whatever to
ensure a server of last resort etc.  I suppose that's fine.  But if you
export these in answers to queries, you should be shot.  These entries
get put in caches and never die.

Suspects: all BINDs.

Suggested domain meta-rule:

	If you must lie, lie to yourself.

6) Backup servers which don't backup.  The rules say that your database
should be available from redundant servers.  If you only have one
computer, you can find a buddy, and back each other up.  But you don't
just find the name of a buddy, you are also supposed to actually back
each other up.

7) All RRs with the same name, class, and type should have the same
TTL.  The logic here is that all of them will timeout simultaneously if
cached and hence the cache can be reliably used for QTYPES which don't
match multiple types.

Suspects: DECWRL.DEC.COM, GODOT.THINK.COM, LABREA.STANFORD.EDU for type=a
	  Many others.

8) Delegation information should be consistent at all of the delegator
and delegatee zones.  For example, XXX delegates to ZZZ.XXX, the XXX
and ZZZ.XXX servers should have identical lists of NS RRs for ZZZ.XX.
Ideally, they should have the same TTLs.

Suspects: RICE.EDU, BERKELEY.EDU and many others

9) The domain system is supposed to preserve case, but be case
insensitive.  However, it does nobody any good to put both RRs for
domain name xxx and XXX in the data base - It merely makes caching
ambiguous and decreases the efficiency of compression.  This consistency
should also exist in the duplicate RRs that mark delegation in the
delegator and delegatee.  For example, if you ask the NIC to delegate
UZOO.EDU to you, your database shouldn't say uzoo.edu.

Suspects: ucbvax.berkeley.edu, UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU

10) Don't use aliases where they only can cause trouble.  For example,
if you use a NS RR to mark delegation, use the primary name of the
server in the RR rather than the alias - all you are doing is slowing
resolvers down.  Similarly, don't use both the alias and the primary
name.

Suspects: If you ask ucbarpa.berkeley.edu about the BERKELEY.EDU zone,
	  it will tell you that there are authoritative servers known
	  as ucb-vax.berkeley.edu, ucbvax.berkeley.edu and
	  ucbarpa.berkeley.edu itself.  The first two appear to be the
	  same host ( or should be if they aren't.)
