    The HINFO data is useless other than for display to users for
    informational purposes.  So you standardize on some name for
    VMS or UNIX, what does that get you?  

I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or serious.  There ARE systems
out there that care A LOT about the system type.  This isn't
speculation, this is fact.  There ARE users who use those machines.
Specifically, Lisp Machines can deal with a large variety of system
types for transparent file access.  The user interface for pathnames is
that their syntax matches the syntax of the system the file lives on.
Therefore, we get the following different types of pathnames:
	UNIX:/usr/foobar/baz.tx
	VMS:[usr.foobar]baz.txt
	TOPS-20:&lt;usr.foobar&gt;baz.txt
	LispM:&gt;usr&gt;foobar&gt;baz.text
If the Lisp Machine, by using the domain system, cannot determine the
pathname syntax, which it infers from the system type, which is in the
HINFO, then the USER cannot specify files on that host and cannot get
pathname merging, etc, etc.

As for NFS, RFC, TCP/IP, etc, etc, the Lisp Machine deals with those
too, and that is why it is important for WKS data to be accurate and
complete.  With proper WKS, the LispM can "choose" the "best" file
access path.

The Lisp Machine also knows how to choose among available networks,
again based on available addresses at the other end.  This includes
Internet, Chaosnet and DECnet.  It would also include XNS and others if
somebody implemented them for the Lisp Machine.  This is why ADDRESS
records of classes other than INTERNET are important.

If you think this is all pie-in-the-sky, it isn't.  It exists today and
has for several years.  Someday Unix (and clones/offshoots), VMS and
others will have it, and systems that don't will be considered archaic.

This all ties into the heterogenous networking concepts that are
starting to receive a lot of attention.  To some degree, we've already
done that.  We did it largely out of practical need.  The research
underway will likely point out improvements.

    Next you'll need to know
    what sort of TCP code is being used on that system.

That would sometimes be useful, especially in the early days of TCP when
some implementations were technically broken but worked by using a
subset of the spec (e.g., by not sending overlapping windows).

Another thing that would be useful is knowing what version of bind a
certain unix is running.  That would allow programs expect certain
classes of errors and avoid those situations.  Of course, better still
would be uniform implementations.
