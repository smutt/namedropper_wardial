In response to your explicit questions:

&gt; Question 1: If the answer it gets from the Internet is authoritative,
&gt; should it relay the answer to the workstation with the authoritative bit
&gt; still set?  I think so.  Otherwise, What's the point of Recursion
&gt; Desired?

AA should be set; the site resolver just resends the received reply
after storing answers in its cache.

&gt; Now suppose some other workstation asks the exact same question of the
&gt; Site Resolver with Recursion Desired in a very short amount of time.

&gt; Question 2: What happens?  Options:
&gt;  a  The Site Resolver returns the data in the cache without
&gt;     Authoritative Answer set.
&gt; 	Question 2a: Why should the second workstation get an answer
&gt; 	    different than the first workstation?  (Namely, a difference
&gt; 	    in Authoritative Answer.) 
&gt; 	Question 2b': Why should the workstation now be burdened with
&gt; 	    going to the Internet to get authoritative data?  What if it
&gt; 	    isn't connected to the Internet?

The data should now be returned without AA set, indicating that it is from
the cache.  The second workstation should get a different answer both
in this respect, and that the answer should include an authority section
including the server(s) from whence the answer was derived.  The TTL
should be decreased by the time difference between the two responses.

My question, in response to 2b, is why should the workstation feel
obligated to go the the authoritative source?  If it trusts the site
resolver and its cache, it ought to be sufficient to use the site resolver's
answer.  Yes, I know, this makes some assumptions; let's examine them,
because this is a useful configuration and ought to be made workable.
First, I believe that a resolver, site-wide or otherwise, ought to group
related data, such as addresses for a host or servers for a domain,
and ought to discard all related data when any of it times out.
(The current version of BIND does this, in fact.)  Then, when a client
queries for a single type (e.g., addresses for a host), it can be sure
that the answer it receives is complete.  This leaves the problem
of wildcard types (or classes, which are potentially worse, as the
servers are not necessarily the same).  For queries with wildcard
types, either the client is willing to accept partial information,
or wishes to quickly determine whether anything is known locally
(I think you mentioned this in one of your messages recently).

In the future, I'd like to have the servers remember the type of query
used to retrieve data in the cache, so that answers can be known to be complete.
For example, the results of a request for type ANY can be assumed complete
for the shortest time in any of the records returned.  (This may be
problematical, actually; more transient traits may exist, and an SOA
may need to be consulted for a minimum value.)  Even this capability
leads to a question: when a server receives a request for type ANY,
and it has information not known to be complete, when it has not asked
for all information, should it return partial information from the cache?
Unfortunately, there is no mechanism for the client to convey its wish
for complete vs. partial information.  It might be nice to define
the AA bit in a query as meaning a request for complete, if not authoritative,
information.  For now, I believe that a server should return possibly-partial
information in response to such a query.  A client wishing definitive
information of a given type (A, MX, etc.) should be requested explicitly
to determine its existence, and a response to such a query should include
all or none of the records of that type for the name and class.
