I am somewhat confused by the concept of class, especially in RR's other
than the obvious ones such as A or WKS.  Specifically I have some questions:

1. SOA records: As I read the spec, zones of authority are allowed to break
down not only along naming boundaries but along classes as well, and that's
what the class field in the SOA record refers to.  A server may happen to
be authoritative for domain FOO.COM in class IN but not in class CS, and in
fact the RFC recommends that the data be kept in separate structures even
within a single server.  The implication is that there are distinct
'master files' for the two classes, with no requirement for coordination
between them.  Consequently the name space really breaks down into
[CS]FOO.COM and [IN]FOO.COM: a priori the CS zone tree may have domain
names in it which don't appear at all the IN zone tree and vice versa, and
the zones might even have the same names in use to refer to different
hosts.  This would make the whole scheme useless for inter-network mail,
since a name appearing in say, a mail header, gives no indication of the
intended class.

I would suggest that the spec explicitly require that each domain must
insure that, in cases of any splitting of authority or information along
classes, the name space itself must remain consistent.  I.e. a request with
any domain and Class=IN can give an authoritative name error IF AND ONLY IF
the same domain with Class=CS will give an authoritative name error, etc.
(modulo updating delays when dealing with separate servers).  This might be
achieved by having all servers, regardless of class, read the same master
files (and possibly discard uninteresting data, such as A records for all
other classes), but in any case, however it is achieved, it should be
required.

2. NS records: I assume the class field here refers to the class of the
domain being served, not the class of the name server.  I.e. it has to do
with the class in which authority is being delegated.  The rfc should state
this explicitly.

3. CNAME records: In keeping with my suggestion in 1, I think CNAME records
should be class-independent.  I.e. hosts should not be allowed to have
different nicknames in different classes.  Either all CNAME records should
have class * or the rfc should require the same set of CNAME records for
each class.

4. MD/MB/MF records: Well, let's see.  One possibility is that the class
field here refers to the host in the RDATA field, as in "If you're on the
Internet, you can get mail to X.FOO.COM by connecting to the following
host, which can then deliver the mail by whatever means", the implication
being that the host in the RDATA field is in fact on the Internet (in the
sense of having A-type RR's in that class) regardless of whatever/wherever
X.FOO.COM itself is.  However, it seems to me that the possibility of
delegation of authority along class lines would require that the class
field be associated with the domain of the RR, not with any data in the RR.
I.e. how can a server have authoritative data for X.FOO.COM if it delegates
authority at FOO.COM for some subset of the classes.

Ok, so the other possibility is that it refers to the class of the domain,
as in "If you mean the Internet X.FOO.COM, you can send mail there by
getting it to the following host somehow or other", with the specified host
not necessarily being on the Internet.  It's up to the server to find out
if/how it can get to the host, which it can do by e.g. type=A queries for
the classes it understands, or by some non-domain-system means.  This makes
a lot of sense, except that it seems to me that the there is absolutely no
reason for the answer to this question to be any different from "If you
mean the CSNet X.FOO.COM, you can send mail here via this host".

5. MG/MR records: Under what circumstances would a mailing lists/alias be
dependent on the class??
