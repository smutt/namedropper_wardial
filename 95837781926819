	Fallacy 1.   The NRS choice was made in parallel with the US one.
	The original syntax was different too (underscore, not dot).
	Some of us presented the US work, and suggested alignment.
	We won on the syntax, and lost on the order.   Sigh.
	
Steve,

As you remember I was at UCL at the time, and this is not the way I
remember it.  I was heading the Grey-Book committee, and attended at
least one NRS meeting in London.  I think the Internet had already
chosen an order, which must have been included in your presentation
of the US work.  As you admit, the English group made a conscious
decision to choose the other order.  Well, they certainly have a
right to do that, although I (and you) think it was a mistake.

	
	Fallacy 3.  This is not a design problem.   There is a detailed
	note considering the problems of mapping.  (mailgroup note 15
	- mapping between RFC 822 and JNT Mail).  I can send you a
	copy if you wish.   There  are a number of tradeoffs you can
	make at the mapping point.   The "theoretically correct"
	mapping has a lot of difficulties with real users.   The
	approach I chose for MMDF was conscious.   The gateway can
	deal with potentially palindromic names (uk.isi.edu), but it
	must be able to access the name (e.g. thru a Domain Nameserver).
	Genuinely palindromic cases (Denis's example) must be resolved
	one way or the other (i.e. you lose).
	
I don't understand all this.   I would expect UCL to be able to tell
whether a message came from the Internet world or from the UK world by
the receive channel, independently of parsing addresses.  I can
imagine there will be funny exceptions, and that to resolve these you
have to depend upon name domain/NRS lookups.

I believe that you have studied the problems, and understand them better
then I do.  However, if it is necessary for your mapping that the
lowest-level Internet domain names be restricted from using names that
you use at the top level, then we are in trouble.  We have created two
truly non-interworking mail universes.
