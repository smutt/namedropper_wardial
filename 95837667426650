Rick Adams -

     I see no evidence to back your assertion that "TOPS20 people
are strongly dominant in deciding the final form of the various
RFC's."  The only evidence of domination I have observed is that
the people who tend to push through RFC's are strongly opposed to
unnecessary OS or machine dependence.  If they weren't that way,
there never would have been any Unix systems on the network at all
because in the old days most of the network sites were PDP-10's
running Tenex.

     Your comment about host number to host name mapping amazes
me.  I can see why a poor or kludgy implementation of naming would
need this sort of function.  It's what older TOPS-20 software used
too, before it was recognized that that sort of thing fell apart
in a number of real operational situations.

     Just because a piece of software was written for Unix does
not automatically make it golden.  OS independence and flexibility
in the face of a continually evolving and changing Internet is the
whole name of the game.  A well-tempered Internet implementation
should avoid any use of Internet addresses until the very last
instance of composing and sending the actual datagrams across.  I
admit this is a bit extreme, but in this day of multi-address hosts
and multi-host addresses(!), I don't see much of a choice.
