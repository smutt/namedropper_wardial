I may regret the day I built an email gateway.

I built (the Internet side of) an email gateway into CompuServe.  It
has at long last been announced reasonably formally by all parties
concerned, and is passing a hefty quantity of mail - some 625 messages
in the last 24 hours alone.  It's running fine, and modulo some
difficulties mostly from the CompuServe side due to people being
unfamiliar with the "culture" (read: addressing standards) in use Out
Here, there are few complaints.

However, I have heard from a dozen or more people, all on MILNet sites
(significantly), who have difficulties because their systems don't use
nameservers yet, and so they can't find compuserve.com directly.  They
are all trying to be quite cordial, explaining the difficulty, which
they understand quite well without exception, asking if something
could be done or making suggestions about how to improve the
situation.  The suggestions range from "get CompuServe registered with
the NIC using the MX host's IP address" (absurd) through "change the
MX host to tut.cis.ohio-state.edu instead of saqqara" (almost
reasonable; but what good will it do in general if nameservers are not
in use?) to "get saqqara.cis.ohio-state.edu registered with the NIC"
(a definite possibility).

But I must admit to a lack of understanding on why the Real Solution
To The Problem, namely the installation of a nameserver and
MX-cognizant mailer, poses such difficulty for MILNet sites.  Is there
a good reason why a lack of nameserver support is still tolerated
anywhere?  One person did mention in response to a similar question
from me that in many cases the issue relates to defense contractors
being budgeted for just so many things, and installation/support of
new mailer technology isn't part of the deal.

This is as close to a good reason as I've heard, but I have
nonetheless come extremely close to making an open offer to _anyone_
to install a trivial nameserver configuration and RFC-compliant
sendmail setup in exchange for some flat consulting fee and root
privileges on the system in question for one hour.  If I were actually
to do so, I'd expect to be an extremely wealthy man by the end of next
week.  It's not like any of these systems seems to need to do major
NIC registration things and domain setup and all that - they just need
to get a caching-only configuration in a nameserver, and a sendmail.cf
that understands how to use MX records.  No sweat - I install things
like that almost without thinking by now.

Is there a good reason for no-nameserver tolerance?  Am I missing an
important (and surely DoD-bureaucratic) justification for this
foolishness?
