&gt; Turning the tables, do you agree that my scheme can also work?

No, I'm afraid I don't believe your scheme can work without both:

    (1) The addition of a site indicator to every mail record.

    (2) A good definition of site.

I actually think that (2) is harder.  A site does not correspond to
an organization, at least not in this day and age.  Many organizations
have sub organizations which are on different networks.  Even within
the sub-organizations, different machines may be on different networks
and *may not* communicate internally.

What this suggests is that you need to be able to route arbitrarily
based on a name.  I.e. give an domain name, you should be able to
direct its mail to any point you choose.  That's what MXs do.

Originally, in RFC 882, we thought that dividing the world into mail
destinations (MD) and mail forwarders (MF) was the right split.  (I
suspect that MF may correspond to your notion of site).  That doesn't
work -- beyond being too simple a model, using more than one type
of RR allows mail loops to form.  (There were problems where your
cache timed out on the MDs before it timed out on the MFs -- if you
were an MD, you might not know it and send the mail off to an MF).

In other words, complex models of the mail world seem to be *less* useful,
than simple general models.  So even if you defined the notion of site,
I'm not sure your scheme isn't more limiting than MXs.

Happy to be proved wrong.
