&gt; 
&gt; In the recent past there has been some talk about which IP address to use
&gt; when the resolver returns more than 1 for a destination address. For the most
&gt; part the problem has been past off as no problem. [ ... ]

(First, let me encourage you to use a "Subject:" when posting to
 mailing lists...)

I think you oversimplify the problem, and hence the solution.  There
are several reasons why this is an incredibly complex problem, but
all of it goes back to the fact that IP should not have allowed
different addresses for multi-homed hosts.  Anyway, no use crying
over spilt milk...

The solution is to have the application query the kernel (or perhaps
a user-space daemon [at least under UNIX]) which address in a list
is preferred given (1) protocol (2) type-of-service and
(3) available routing information.  The first two criteria would be
set by the application, the last collected by the "resolver".  The
information is potentially of a highly dynamic nature, and static
solutions such as your's will not prove to be sufficiently robust.

Indeed, certain information might be returned to the application
(such as estimated best-case bandwidth/latency) that would allow
an application to decide what services it was willing to offer
and which it might defer (an FTP might ask you if you wanted to
queue a large transfer for a later time).

I think this is a problem few of us are ready to solve.  In any
event, it is not an issue for the DNS server or client.  It is
a routing issue.
