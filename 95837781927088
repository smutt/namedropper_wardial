	Subject: timeout-out CNAME and non-timedout data
	
	The violation is in having both a CNAME and an HINFO.  I had always
	assumed that you would be required to manipulate the TTL's so that you
	didn't have unexpired conflicting information, or at least not for
	more than a few hours.  I think there is a concensus that one-year
	TTL's are not acceptable.  I don't think people are using more than a
	week.  My view (which others have also supported) is that if you are
	using one week TTL's, you set them down to one day at least a week
	before making any change that owuld introduce an inconsistency of this
	kind.  Then to one hour a day before making the change etc.  Except that
	at some point you decide that you're willing to live with being
	inaccessible for a certain period of time and just don't bother.  In
	that case, it doesn't much matter what an implementatio does about
	"impossible" things, since the domain administrator has chosen to be
	inconsistent for a certain period of time.  The only proviso I would
	add is that you should make sure not to get into a loop when things
	are invalid.  In that case, simply returning the information that
	appears to be valid, or failing, is probably safer than going off and
	making queries into a distributed database that is likely not to be
	consistent.
