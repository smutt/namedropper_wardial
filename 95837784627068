&gt; If anyone can suggest any (reasonable) magic solution to

&gt; learn the appropriate source route, and use it.

Well, this is so far perhaps the best argument I've yet seen, but I'm still
not convinced; I'll try to explain why.

The fact that talking to the gateway is more costly from one side (B) than
the other seems to be what introduces the complexity, since it means you
need different policies for the two sides for mail destined for B.

&gt;From A:

	If you can see B, deliver the mail.
	If you can see G but not B, give the mail to G.

This amounts to a wildcard MX for all of B pointed at G.

&gt;From B:

	If you can see the other B, deliver the mail
	If you can see G but not the other B, try again later.

This amounts to the absence of the aforementioned wildcard MX.

Using source routing as you've described amounts to defaulting mail from
A to case #2, which is about the same cost as #1 (I assume), thus allowing
both sides to see the same DNS, which has wins for things other than mail.

I still think that this policy should be handled automatically, rather than
by every person who happens to want to send mail to B.  I think that some
variation on the dual-nameserver idea is still the way to go, since what
you want is for G to be a default mail handler for one side but not the
other.  Perhaps something could be done based on the fact that in the cases
where you want A sites to drop their mail on G, they won't be able to see
the primary nameserver for B; however, having a secondary that gives different
information than its primary strikes me as being bad magic...

Yuck.  However, a primary nameserver for B that returns different MX
information depending on who's asking seems to be the least of the several
evils here.

A smaller-scale version of the same problem is an organization with a good
internal network and an up-sometimes link to the outside world (say, dialup
SLIP).  The far endpoint should accept incoming mail from other sites, but
you never want mail from inside to go across the link unless it really is
destined for a host off of the internal network, even if the destination
is down and the link (and thus the far endpoint machine, which can accept
its mail) is up.
