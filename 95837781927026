The spec doesn't come out and explicitly state how Recursion Desired,
Recusrion Available, Authoritative Answer, and caching (especailly on a
local site resolver/nameserver) interact.  Here's the situation at our
site, and potentaially at many other sites.

	+---------------+
	| Workstation	|		+---------------+
	|w/ local cache	|&lt;=============&gt;|		|
	+---------------+		| Site resolver	|
					|      aka	|
		...			|Site Nameserver|&lt;===&gt; Big-I Internet
					|		|
	+---------------+	RD-&gt;	|recursion avail|
	| Workstation	|&lt;=============&gt;|cache for site	|
	|w/ local cache	|   &lt;-RA, AA?	+---------------+
	+---------------+

The purpose of the caches is to reduce network traffic.  The purpose of
the site resolver is to reduce network traffic on the Big-I Internet by
supporting a common cache for the entire site.  A site resolver could
also be used to field domain request for workstations which are on some
network other than the Internet.

The first time a workstation asks for some data, it isn't in the local
cache, so it asks the site resolver with Recursion Desired.  The site
resolver, the first time, doesn't have it either, so it must go to the
Internet for the answer.  Presumably it looks for authoritative data.
When it gets the data, it enters it into its own cache (the one for the
site) and then passes it back to the workstation.

Question 1: If the answer it gets from the Internet is authoritative,
should it relay the answer to the workstation with the authoritative bit
still set?  I think so.  Otherwise, What's the point of Recursion
Desired?

Now suppose some other workstation asks the exact same question of the
Site Resolver with Recursion Desired in a very short amount of time.

Question 2: What happens?  Options:
 a  The Site Resolver returns the data in the cache without
    Authoritative Answer set.
	Question 2a: Why should the second workstation get an answer
	    different than the first workstation?  (Namely, a difference
	    in Authoritative Answer.) 
	Question 2b': Why should the workstation now be burdened with
	    going to the Internet to get authoritative data?  What if it
	    isn't connected to the Internet?
 b  The Site Resolver, presumably because Recursion Desired is set, goes
    off to the Internet in order to get authoritative data, and relays
    the response.
	Question 2b: What good is the site-wide cache?  It certainly
	    isn't reducing traffic on the Internet now.
 c  The Site Resolver, using some data-is-still-authoritative criterion,
    returns the data in the cache, with appropriately reduced TTLs, with
    the Authoritative Answer bit set.
	This is what I'd like to do, and what I hope the intent of
	    caching is supposed to allow.
	Question 2c: What is the data-is-still-authoritative criterion?
 d  Something else?

This question applies to both valid data, no data and name-errors.  

I have some ideas for the data-is-still-authoritative criterion, but I
would first like to resolve the intent of the spec before fine tuning
the criterion.
