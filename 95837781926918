    Is it totally a local matter to decide if a real secondary server
    is the one requesting a zone transfer?  Does anyone use the
    secondary (name) server RR to check against requests (i.e., have
    some automated security related to the authoritative database?

Gee, and here I thought that it was a perfectly reasonable thing for a
totally unknown machine to ask for a zone transfer, presumably because
said requestor wants to cut down on the amount of UDP query traffic.
Of course, the server administrator is permitted to cause requests to
be rejected if there's some good reason, but I certainly don't think
that the default should be to refuse transfers to everybody but your
secondary servers.

Eg, for the LCS.MIT.EDU machines I maintain, an awful lot of the mail
traffic is to hosts in a small number of zones (a few universities, a
few MIT spinoff companies, the other zones at MIT).  I see no reason
why I shouldn't be able to cut daytime network load by doing zone
transfers of these zones during the wee hours (SOA parameters
permitting).  Of course there will be cases where one needs updates
faster than once per day, but I suspect these cases are in the
minority.  Such a scheme is not only beneficial to the machine
requesting the transfers, it also helps batch the network overhead
associated with the domain system to a time when the network and most
hosts aren't as loaded.

I would not advise this with the current bind architecture, but bind
can be fixed, and (contrary to popular opinion) bind isn't the only
program playing the domain game.

Sorry, Walt, I know this isn't really what you meant, but the
implications of your question seemed to be headed in the wrong
direction.
