The following is an extract of an exchange between D. Plummer and me. I think
the issue addressed is central enough to the question of what to do with
MR, MG, and MB records that it should be raised even before we address the
goal questions raised by KARP (which I agree we need to address next!).
        
            I believe that what RFC-883 says doesn't address the syntax in the
            mail world but that name@domain would be used in the name.domain form to do
            the lookup that you describe.
        
        Unfortunately, that's wrong, because mailbox@maildrop and
        name-of-user-domain-or-otherwise aren't the same thing.  It might be a
        CONVENTIENT SYNTAX CONVERSION but it isn't THE SAME THING.
        
            Unfortunately that makes name@domain and mailbox@maildrop look the same.
        Agreed.
            Anytime that one introduces an address mapping type transformation it would be
            nice to differentiate between "resolved" and "unresolved" addresses, but that
        This is only a problem if you try to use the same syntax for two
        purposes.  I'm proposing using two syntaxes for the two different
        purposes.
            is a problem with which we have been stuck for a longe time (e.g. the same
            thing happens with aliasing schemes and they may introduce loops if you are
            not careful in your definition). However, I am not sure that we would want
            to wait for any necessary changes to the mail protocols before introducing
            name binding in a more general fashion. We have been doing it around here for
            a long time without too much pain.
        
        Yow, good for you!  Indeed, somebody has to take the lead, be it the
        naming system or the mailer.
        
I believe that what David and I agree on, is that any mailer must be able to
determine the meaning of the label that sticks on an envelope that arrives
at the mailer before it can do a reasonable job at completion of mailbox
binding and/or delivering the envelope. In particular in the MR, MB context
it must know what kind of binding has already taken place.

In addition I believe we both agree that in an ideal world we would like for
the mail protocols to somehow communicate this type of information. The
question that we must address is if we want to fix the mail protocols first,
so that they carry the information, or if we want to use the current mail
protocols and make do with something less than ideal.

P.S. If we are to change the mail protocols, one possible solution is clearly
to represent the type of binding applied in differing forms of address field
syntax. However, if we are to change the mail protocols I would think there
would be lots of other issues to be addressed, and there may be better
solutions for this particular problem (e.g. different commands and replies
in the SMTP exchange).

Unfortunately I am currently going from the assumption that we will be unable
to overhaul the mail protocols in the short term. For this reason, and this
reason only, I am trying to find a solution where determination of the kind
of binding is detected by semantics. The only solution of this kind that I
have been able to come up with is to make the sets of expanded domain names
that occur on MR records (both name field and RDATA field) and MG records
(RDATA field) disjoint from the set of expanded domain names in the name field
of all MB records. Any proposal for a better solution is greatly appreciated!

So here is THE question: Are we going to find definitions for the MR, MG, and
MB records such that meaningful implementations can be made using the current
mail protocols, or are we first going to agree on and implement new mail
protocols?

Who would like to tally the vote? AG
