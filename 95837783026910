				   TUTORIALS
				August 16, 1988
				9:00 am - 5:00 pm

	            1. INTEGRATED SERVICES DATA NETWORKS:
			  NARROWBAND AND BROADBAND
			      (Mario Gerla, UCLA)


				   Abstract

ISDN is one of the newest " buzzwords " in the communications arena.
The concept is extremely appealing: by integrating various services (
voice, data, video etc.) in a common network we will be able to achieve
lower operating costs, higher efficiency, better
availability/maintainability and higher flexibility in the introduction
of new services.This concept is now becoming a reality, and both users
and service providers are taking into account the potential of ISDN's
in formulating their plans.

This seminar will review the evolution of the ISDN concept during the
past few years,will discuss the standard recommendations, will compare
implemen- tation alernatives and finally will report on recent field
trials.  In organizing this seminar , the attempt was to maintain a
good balance between design principles, standard recommendations and
actual network implementations.


		                Outline

	- Why integrated services
	- Narrowband and Broadband ISDN's
	- Standard recommendations
	- ISDN backbone implementation alternatives
	   ( Packet/Circuit/Hybrid switching)
	- ISDN routing and flow control
	- Service integration in MAN's and LAN's
	- Field trials
	- Future trends

                              Biography

Professor Mario Gerla received the PhD degree in engineering from the
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1973.  From 1973 to
1976, he was Network Planning Manager at Network Analysis Corporation.
&gt;From 1976 to 1977, he was with Tran Telecommunications, Los Angeles,
where he participated in the development of integrated packet and
circuit networks.  In 1977, he joined UCLA and is now a Professor in
the Department of Computer Science.  His research interests include the
design and control of distributed computer communications systems and
networks, and the development of high-speed local area networks.
 

   		2. MULTI-HOP TOPOLOGIES, BRIDGES AND ROUTERS
			   (Radia Perlman, DEC)

			         Abstract

A Local Area Network (LAN) allows direct communication between any
stations directly connected to the LAN.  Route computation and
forwarding nodes are not necessary.  However, technology and
performance constrains the topology, distance, and number of stations
of a single LAN.  Thus a network usually needs to grow beyond the
limits of a single LAN.  One method of interconnecting LANs is through
"Bridges".  Two different schemes for interconnecting LANs are being
standardized by two different subcommittees of the IEEE 802 committee,
which is standardizing LANs.  These two schemes are "spanning
tree/transparent" bridges, and "source routing" bridges.  Another
method of creating a network with multiple links is through "routers".
These too are being standardized by various committees.  "Routers"
perform the "Network Layer Protocol" as defined by the ISO reference
model.

This tutorial will briefly review the ISO reference model.  It will
explain the two bridge schemes, and contrast their functionality and
performance.  It will explain the functionality of the Network Layer,
and explain design alternatives for meeting this functionality.  The
emphasis will be placed on the design of a "connectionless" style of
Network Layer.  No background other than intellectual curiosity is
required.  Emphasis is on protocol concepts rather than specifics of
the schemes, or mathematical analysis.

                               Outline

     o   ISO Reference Model Review (20 minutes)
     o   LAN review -- CSMA/CD, token ring, token bus (15 minutes)
     o   Bridges -- Spanning Tree, Source Routing, Comparisons (1 1/2
         hours)
     o   Network Layer functionality -- connection oriented vs
         connectionless, routing, fragmentation and reassembly,
         autoconfigurability, addressing (45 minutes)
     o   Routing Algorithms -- "Distance Vector" vs "Link State" (2
         hours)
     o   Depending on time and interest, remaining time can be spent
         exploring the design implications of:
         -   interoperability of spanning tree and source routing
             bridges
         -   Network Layer autoconfigurability
         -   Design implications of hierarchical networks; subnetwork
             partition problem, subnetwork autonomy

                              Biography

Radia Perlman is a consulting engineer at Digital Equipment
Corporation.  She designed the spanning tree algorithm used by
Digital's bridges and adopted for use by both bridge standards
(transparent bridges and source routing bridges).  She also was
responsible for the design and specification of the Network Layer in
Digital's Network Architecture, aspects of which have been adopted by
ISO for use in the standard connectionless Network Layer.

She has taught as adjunct faculty at the graduate schools of Wang
Institute and University of Lowell, and at the Wang Summer Institute.
She received the B.S.  and M.S.  degrees in mathematics at MIT, and is
currently pursuing a Ph.D.  degree in Computer Science at MIT.
