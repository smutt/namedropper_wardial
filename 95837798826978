  I want to respond to part of this on the basis of personal experience and 
reactions...


&gt;	I guess the philosophy puzzles me.  I've always thought of DNS as a
&gt;	way of making it easier for clients to connect to services, not as any
&gt;	sort of authentication system.
   I've never seen it as, strictly, an authentication system either.  And I 
wouldn't advocate a host that can't reverse map refusing a connection.  But 
I must admit that I get very nervous when I get an attempted login or ftp 
attempt from a host that I can't identify by name.

&gt;	At this site we have 2000 machines on LocalTalk networks using dynamic
&gt;       IP address assignment and supporting no IP services.  Is it really
&gt;	necessary for security for us to give them all names (actually, give
&gt;	the addresses names) and put them in our domain database?  Surely if
&gt;	intrusive activity is coming from one of these machines it's easy to
&gt;	determine where it's at by looking at the network part of its IP
&gt;	address? 
  I don't know how Stanford operates, but, speaking very pragmatically, 
when one of the possible penetration attempts above happens, and I can't 
reverse map a host name, I've sometimes sent mail to the person identified 
by looking at the network part of the IP address as the admin contact.  
Over the last several months (only), I've had such mail not answered, 
bounce, or given rude "how should we know what host that is, just because 
they are using one of our numbers".  I've also been told that up to date 
information was given to the NIC "a long time ago", but had not made it to 
the WHOIS database (this is the traditional "blame the NIC" excuse, a close 
relative to "the check is in the mail").
   So I would be a lot happier if addresses reversed mapped, and reverse 
mapped to DNS records that could be used to track down plausible 
postmasters and zone contacts.  And I'm happier if that information is 
something that you get to maintain locally, so that "blame the NIC" doesn't 
work.
   But I don't think that set of requirements/desires translates into "give 
them all names... and put them into our domain database".  Or, at least, 
that it shouldn't.  So, let me suggest an idea that I think is consistent 
with the current RFCs, even if a little radical....
    Since you have enough machinery around to dynamically assign IP 
addresses, what happens if you make a set of DNS records called, e.g.,
"dynamic.stanford.edu".  If I ask for HINFO, I get some nice stuff that 
points me to humans who can explain, and the SOA records correspond.  There 
is no A-record, and, if you like, you can make an MX and point it somewhere 
(since you probably have a "somewhere".  Now you modify the server a bit so 
that, if someone makes a reverse mapping inquiry for *any of those 
addresses*, you return the name "dynamic.stanford.edu", e.g., you provide 
an effective wildcard for the class of IP addresses that you give out 
dynamically.  That would satisfy my claimed need to reverse map.  It would 
probably satisfy a host that tried to reverse map, as long as its 
validation did not get anal about the process and insist on getting an A 
record and verifying that they matched.  And you wouldn't have to give 
those things names and put them in your tables (which would be misleading 
anyway, because the names would probably change everytime you dynamically 
supplied an IP address).

  Bob Braden: that would be, more or less, my candidate outline for "the 
right thing" for a future HR revision to say.   Probably it would require 
some text elsewhere since, by the criteria proposed the last time, this 
goes well beyond a "clarification" to anything I can think to hang it on.
