? From: Craig Partridge &lt;craig@nnsc.nsf.net&gt;

?     The suggestion that one deliver to an A RR if the MX RRs are not
? currently accessible is, in my view, broken.

?     The purpose of MX RRs and RFC 974 was to make MXs *the* way
? to route mail -- the rule of trying the A RR if no MXs existed was
? intended only to act as a safety net, not an excuse to ignore routes.
? (Indeed, my recollection is that we very nearly didn't allow mailing
? to A RRs at all).

?     In general, if a mailer haven't seen the answer to the query for MX RRs
? it has no idea where to mail the message, and mailing to the A RR is asking
? for trouble.

? Craig

Gee, I guess we'd better get on the ball and put all the MX records in.
Hey, since y'all are secondary servers for nbs.gov (soon to become nist.gov,
sigh, the last vestige of NBS) maybe you'd like to do it for us :-)

But seriously, you provoked me into thinking about something.

Suppose we have two hosts a.nbs.gov and b.nbs.gov who wish to act as
backup mailers for each other. Each could have a low numberer MX record
for itself and a high numbered record for the other guy, like so:

	$ORIGIN nbs.gov.
	a	IN	A	129.6.48.1
		IN	MX	10 a
		IN	MX	20 b
	b	IN	A	129.6.48.2
		IN	MX	10 b
		IN	MX	20 a

That way, if either host was down, mail could be accepted and queued
locally. Will this work? Any sendmail.cf changes required (I say no)?

	Root Boy Jim is what I am
	Are you what you are or what?
