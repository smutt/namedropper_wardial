 A recent message asked how one could find a complete domain name given
 only a part of it, perhaps out of the middle of the lowest level.  One
 way to do this would be transfer a group of resource records to the
 user's machine and let the user do string searches on them.  This
 would probably be done by writing the records into a file.  The user
 could then use his favorite editor to look through them.  This process
 might have to be repeated at more than one level of the domain tree.

 RFC 883 describes completion queries which can be used for this
 purpose, but they are described as obsolete in the draft of the Domain
 Concepts RFC.  Actually, if the part of the name the user remembers is
 not the beginning of the name, the completion query would have to get
 all the names at a level of the domain tree.

 This could be done with a zone transfer, which is a good reason to
 allow a zone transfer.  However, this would probably transfer more
 resource records than necessary such as the host information records.
 Therefore, I would propose adding two new query types: (1) All address
 (A) records and (2) All mail exchanger (MX) records.  These would
 return all records of their respective types so the user could look
 though them and pick the desired one.  Actually, a third query type of
 all address plus all mail exchanger records would be useful.
