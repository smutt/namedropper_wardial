&gt; In short, we ignore the destination user that NJEF gives us and
&gt; parse the TO: field in the header.  ...
&gt; In order to do this, we assume that the header is in the RFC-822 format.

My condolences.  I hack mail software on a Unisys (Sperry?  Univac?) 1100
system and also look at headers.  I have a scrapbook of ugly headers from
BitNet, so I know what you are going through...

&gt; A few weeks ago one of our users joined a mail list called NAnet.
&gt; The host appears to be na@score.stanford.edu.arpa.

I dunno about that site name.  The ".arpa" is very bogus.  It should be
either &lt;oldname&gt;.arpa or &lt;newname&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.edu but to my knowlege having
both edu and arpa is wrong.

Note that old software that ASSUMED a bare (undomainified) name might
*generate* this kind of address.  If it translated &lt;anything&gt; coming in a
particular wire to &lt;anything&gt;.arpa it could very well translate an
incoming "score.stanford.edu" into "score.stanford.edu.arpa" garbage.
Check out the "Received:" lines and see what gateways it's been through...

Also, Internet sites are *SUPPOSED* to maintain the mailbox POSTMASTER for
this kind of query.  If you can send Internet mail, why don't you try a
polite query to  POSTMASTER@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU  and see if they have any
ideas.  At least they might be able to tell you about "na"...

&gt; The problem is the headers start with a blank line, they have
&gt; carriage control in the first column, and their address format
&gt; is &lt;blob@blob&gt; which is marginally legal by RFC-822.

Gack!  Carriage control?  Maybe they are being sent as print files rather
than as punch files...  Dare I ask to subscribe?  :-)

&gt; Is there anyone out there that thinks it is unreasonible to
&gt; expect headers to meet the RFC-822?  I must admit that I thought
&gt; an ARPA host would surely follow the standard.  Is there a new
&gt; standard (with carriage control in the header???) that I haven't
&gt; heard of?  Any suggestions on what can be done in such a situation?

I think it is EMINENTLY reasonable to expect this, but I am a bit biased,
what with trying to run a campus gateway.  Perhaps in reality the best to
hope for is to arrange to *automatically* send back a nastygram or drop the
offending message on the floor.  It gave me an ulcer.  It will give you an
ulcer too if you let it get to you...

One other thing to check is if the "carriage control" you are seeing is
really X.400 addressing stuff.  This is really a shot in the dark...

Depending on the Received: lines, which I haven't seen, I can only suggest
that some nefarious gateway has mugged the header to the form you now see.
The people at Stanford are usually pretty good.  I cannot believe they are
doing stuff like this.


&gt; I feel that I must state an opinion here on Bitnet Mailers.
&gt; From the experiance I've had the last 5 months it appears that
&gt; most sites are using RFC-822 headers most of the time.  From the
&gt; recommendations that I read from the Bitnet Domains Task Force
&gt; it would appear that domain usage will be added in the software
&gt; above the NJEF software.  In my opinion we should be changing our
&gt; mail software to use a single Bitnet user id for all mail.  Thus
&gt; using Bitnet as a reliable data transport between hosts.  Once
&gt; mail got to the host it would be routed by the associated mailer
&gt; from the header information.

The latest bit of nastyness is that some people are trying to erect a
separate and distinct domain names system, with their own shadow EDU
and COM etc domains.  I guess it is a loophole in the BDTF that it did
not say the BitNet domains had to be the same as the Internet domains.

Come on, guys, get real!  Your nastly little politics are killing people...
Can't you forget your little power wars and try to do something for the
common good for a change?

Now for a bit of Internet bigotry:  now that IBM is no longer paying gobs
of money to keep BitNet going, what's to stop us from moving over to a
20'th Century protocol like IP?  Our wires and modems will run IP just as
easily as RSCS.  Why continue to use a glorified remote batch network when
state-of-the-art packet switching is available?
