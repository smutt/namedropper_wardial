RFC883, as far as I can tell, implies that the number of questions in a
QUERY is one, only one, no more and no less.  Does does this by saying
"a question" and labelling that slot in the pictures with "question."
It also labels the answer slot with the singular "answer" even though
there may be many answers.

So... I poked around.  I sent two questions to various types of server hosts,
asking about machines for which they were an authority.  The Unix
systems I tried (bitsy.mit.edu, prep.ai.mit.edu, bbn.com) all replied
with a format error.  (bbn.com is actually running Ultrix.)  They also
replied with a zero-length question field.  The only TOPS-20 I tried,
XX.LCS.MIT.EDU also replied with a format error, and additionally
returned the original questions in the reponse.  Symbolics appears to
look at the first question and returns a response containing all the
questions but only returns answer(s) for the first.

Should multiple questions work?  (This is a design question, not an
implemtation question.)  
  -  If not, why not?  There are some systems out in the world that
     would like to query many things at once.
  -  If so, how should the authority bit be managed?  My guess is that
     it is only valid to set the authority bit if the server is an
     authority for all the answers.  Also, what if some of the questions
     are OK, but some would generate a name-error?  Should that cause a
     non-error response without the authority bit set, or generate a
     name-error which would force the requestor to query each name?
