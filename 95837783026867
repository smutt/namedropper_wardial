We have a large, growing network of workstations.  When people want to
get at them from home via terminal/PC and modem, they dial a Micom
port selector, ask for a Bridge CS/1T at the "Host Name?" prompt, and
from there they have to say "connect &lt;host&gt;.cis.ohio-state.edu" in
order to get connected with a particular host.

With the way we've got things set up, one Sun workstation is just
about as good as any other.  In fact, if we've done our job right,
they're utterly identical.  For the sake of load balancing, we'd like
to have the users show up pretty randomly on the beasties in order to
prevent any one (e.g.) Sun3/50 from getting overloaded with too many
emacses or whatever.  So what we would like to be able to do is have
the users request "connect sun.cis.ohio-state.edu" and get a
randomly-selected Sun out of the set of Suns available.

Has anyone implemented anything of this sort in named?  If so, is
there a way I can get at your copy of named to pick out your
modifications and adapt them to my own needs?

On the assumption that no one has actually done so and I will have to
do it myself, here's what I've got in mind thus far.  I haven't looked
over the existing code any too closely yet, not having had the time to
get really involved in it.

I would like to be able to specify a new directive in my boot file,
something like

random	sun.cis.ohio-state.edu	128.146.29.0 128.146.28.0 128.146.27.0
random	hp.cis.ohio-state.edu	128.146.8.100 128.146.8.101 128.146.8.102

where the domain specified in the 2nd field is the `alias' by which a
machine will be requested, and the subnets specified are the addresses
which are matchable by that domain name.  I would want the number of
available subnets to be fairly large; I already have 11 subnets worth
of Sun3/50s which need to be made available.  In the second case,
those are of course complete IP addresses, not subnet idents, because
(as a special case for us) we have a set of HP 9000/300 workstations
which live on our backbone ethernet that should be similarly
addressable.

Then the code which notices a `random' name request for an A record
should search out the available set of hosts which are applicable and
pick one as randomly as possible.  Alternatively, I would be quite
partial to thoughts of a ruptime-style query to find a host with no
users on it, and give preference to those machines, going for the
totally random approach only if no zero-user machine is available.

Does this look workable?  Is a new directive in the boot file the
proper place to do this?  Is the number of addresses specifiable in a
directive limited in all cases to the flat MAXNS limit?  (I suppose I
could create a bunch of `random' sets if so, with 3 subnets apiece.
sun[1234].cis.ohio-state.edu.  hp[123].cis.ohio-state.edu.  Ick.)  Any
other Better Ideas?  I would greatly appreciate any critique and
opinion about it.
