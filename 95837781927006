    I'm afraid I'm confused here.  We can do what you want with MX plus
    wildcards.

Not really, but it's a little hard to explain why.  It mostly has to do
with "Names don't mean anything.  Names name objects.  Objects mean
something."  Maybe it's because I'm opposed to associating data (e.g., MX
records) with names.  I associate data with objects and therefore there
is no such thing as data which is associated with wildcard names.

Turning the tables, do you agree that my scheme can also work?  Do you
have any opinion on whether my scheme is any closer to reality?  (I'm
not sure whether I want to try to persuade people based on closeness to
reality.)

	...
    MX was designed (admittedly by committee) to allow you to generate
    just about any mail routing behavior you desire.  It seems to me (in
    my admittedly biased opinion) you are ragging on a mechanism that actually
    works.

The reason I'm ragging on the mechanism (which I admit works, and which
you admit requires wildcards to work) is that I'm really ragging on the
design behind the mechanism.  That may be where your confusion is.  It
doesn't allow any behavior I want.  It allows the behavior that says:
  "Use the MX record if it exists, else use the host address."
It's simplistic and wildcarded data allows it to work.  I can imagine
that the two major groups inside SCRC.Symbolics.COM (the people who use
the released version of the system and the developers using the
development version) might want to be in separate sites with separate
mail servers.  Since we are both in the zone named SCRC.Symbolics.COM we
either have to put MX records on each machine name, or live with the
fact that half the mail will flow through the wrong machine (the one the
default MX record points to).  I /cannot/ get the mail routing behavior
I desire with wildcards.  I can get it by adding records, but I can do
that in my scheme too.  My scheme also allows a reasonable thing to
happen: ask the site what mail servers to use.
