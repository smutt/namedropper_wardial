I have a strategy question for this group (at least, it seems the best match).
It concerns mail addressing in a world that is still only partially converted
to the name-domain system.

For some time, Berkeley has been rewriting mail From: addresses as
	user%realhost@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU
in all mail from hosts not in the NIC host table, so that recipients
who were not using the name-domain system could reply.  (A small fraction
of our hosts are in the host table, although they include the most-visible
systems.)  (We were using user%realhost@Berkeley.EDU, but some hosttable-only
sites complained that Berkeley.EDU wasn't a canonical name; it is an alias
for ucbvax in the host table.)  Using these return addresses has become
less and less desirable, in part because poor ucbvax (a VAX 11/750) has
become unable to keep up with the mail load most of the time.  It is also
not very desirable from the perspective of the name-domain conversion,
as we are unable to get the full benefit of the name-domain system even
though we've been using it for several years.

We are debating dropping the rewrite and using our domain names exclusively.
Of course, this means that Milnet sites that have not converted will be
unable to reply without manually revectoring mail (either to a nearby
domain-capable machine, or a Berkeley machine in the host table).
I was curious whether other sites are also hiding domain-only names,
or whether they were placing the compatibility burden on the hosttable-only
sites.

At the moment, we're experimenting with rewriting the From: address
of mail messages only if the To: address is in the .arpa domain.
This is imperfect because of mailing lists and because there are
probably some sites that have new domain-style names but don't actually
use a resolver in their mail systems.

How are other sites addressing these issues?  My personal inclination
is "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"-- we should ignore the problems
of hosttable-only sites and put the compatibility burden on them,
in hopes that they will become fewer and fewer.
