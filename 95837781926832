I don't think we are creating any pollution at the moment, but we
certainly might have in the past.  It took us a while to discover
that B.ISI.EDU was no longer a root server.  Rather than swearing
at people who are causing this problem, maybe you'd like to propose
a way that system administrators can avoid doing so.  In particular,
  - do you have any proposal for what to put in named.cache to
	let us find the root servers?  I don't see any alternative
	to listing some subset of root servers.  I mean, the search
	has to start someplace.  And I think an infinite timeout
	makes sense too. If our root entries time out, we're sort
	of dead in the water.
  - how are we supposed to know when the root servers change?

Isn't there a distinction made between authoritative and
non-authoritative data in the name server system?  I would have
hoped that data we put in our database to "prime the pump" would
not be considered authoritative by anybody.  We certainly don't
put in SOA records for the root domain.  Is there a bug in bind
or some other piece of software that makes people believe this
sort of data?
