    At least one of the root nameservers, TERP.UMD.EDU, is responding
    incorrectly to requests about non-existant top-level domains.
    When queries for an address record for "FOO.BAR." it returns a
    NOERROR instead of NXDOMAIN, indicating that the domain exists but
    the record doesn't.

    As for the "brain-damaged-root-server-of-the-day", NS.NASA.GOV
    returns a SERVFAIL to this query.

I moved ns.nasa.gov from a vax to a sun, about the 13th, and no
longer have it serving other primary domains.  It also no longer
sends UDP packets out the wrong interface, as said sun has only
one interface.  The server has been up for six days, and still returns
NXDOMAIN to this query.

I suspect (only a first level suspect, I haven't spent time 
looking at it very much at all) that the incorrect response to
losing queries is in some fashion related to the server choking on
invalid data in the address files.  Up until last week, ns.nasa.gov
also served about 7 local primaries, with the result being 
regular changes to the associated files.  (Not the root distributions,
of course, but others.)  

It is interesting to note that the breakdowns were first noted (or
at least mentioned out loud) when I went away on vacation.  I do not have
normal responsibility for adding new hosts to the local primaries,
but I did monitor syslog and note when someone adding such a host
made a typo, resulting in complaints from bind.  I would also then
quickly see to its correction.  Apparently others were not so careful, as 
while I was gone, such errors hung around for some time.

In any event, ns.nasa.gov now only serves the root, and nasa.gov, 
which is not subject to frequent change.  It also seems remarkably
more stable.  I apologize for inconvienence it may have caused.
