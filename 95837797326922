A while back someone posted a question asking if anyone or anything
was checking up on the DNS (e.g. making sure that the maintainers
of the foo.bar domain also had their part of in-addr.arpa under
control).

Occasionally I'll look through some of our log files to see whose
hosts seem to have their in-addr.arpa domains set up correctly
and whose do not.  I have a list of 47 different domains that I
have contacted over the past two years.  Usually I'll point out
that their IP addresses don't seem to be mapped back into names,
and I'll tell them what they need to do.  Most of the time people
just didn't realize that when they registered their domains they
also needed to start doing nameservice for part of in-addr.arpa
too.  Other times I've gotten answers like "Thanks for letting us
know, but this is just a temporary net that's going to disappear
in a week so we haven't bothered."  Other times the answers have
been more . . . creative.

How does one convince an organization that their part of in-addr.arpa
is set-up incorrectly and that they need to do something about it?
There's one organization that I've mailed several times, but I've
pretty much been given the brush-off.  (The hostmaster for another
organization mailed me back something like "What the HELL were you
doing on MY machine looking at MY files?!"  Seems he wasn't
familiar with zone transfers . .  .)

On a different subject, would it be a good idea to come up with a
list of "Things to do when registering a domain"?  For instance,
I think it is often a good idea to have a hostmaster mailbox for a domain.
Often I've found that when I've mailed to something like bob@foo.bar,
I get a message back saying "Oh, I don't work for them anymore, you
need to mail . . ."  With the hostmaster mailbox (either with a MG
record or in an aliases file) it gives the DNS the same sort of
convention that mail has with the postmaster mailbox.  Also, 'root' can
be part of this group so you *know* someone in authority will see
the piece of mail.  Suggestions and arguments for different values
for TTLs and refresh/retries might also be helpful to people.

Any other thoughts about is such a guide is a good idea or what
might be placed in it?
