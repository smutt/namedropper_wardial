			    The US Domain

The US domain is an official top-level domain in the Domain Name System
(DNS) of the Internet community.  It is registered with the Network
Information Center at SRI International (SRI-NIC).  The domain
administrators are Jon Postel and Ann Westine at the Information
Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (USC-ISI).

The US domain hierarchy is based on political geography, that is, the US
domain is subdivided into states, then cities, and so on.  Any computer
in the United States may be registered in the US domain.

Typical host names in the US domain are:

		VIXIE.SF.CA.US
		DOGWOOD.ATL.GA.US
		KILLER.DALLAS.TX.US
		HOLODEK.SANTA-CRUZ.CA.US
		GRIAN.CPS.ALTADENA.CA.US

Because many computers in the United States are already registered in
the COM, EDU, and other top level domains, relatively few computers are
currently registered in the US domain.  The computers that are
registered are primarily owned by small companies or individuals (and
often located in homes).  It is expected than many more computers of all
types and belonging to all sizes of organizations will be registered in
the US domain.

There is no change in the procedures for registration in, or operation
of, other top-level domains such as COM, EDU, GOV, INT, MIL, NET, or
ORG.  These domains are not being moved under the US domain.

Registration of a host in the US domain does not grant permission to use
the Internet or its component networks.  Any restrictions on sending
mail through (or other use of) the Internet is independent of host
registration in the US domain.  Registration in the US domain does not
allocate any IP address, or cause registration in HOSTS.TXT.

Currently, the US domain and all of its subdivisions (that is, states
and cities) are managed by the US Domain Administrator.  At some time in
the future the administration of individual states and cities will be
transferred to appropriate responsible people.

The administrator of a company or the organizer of a group (or "domain
park") of users with individual hosts may coordinate the registration of
the group by forwarding all the information for the group to the US
Domain Administrator.

The explicit specific information for each host must be provided.  All
fully qualified names must be unique.  If a host is not directly on the
Internet an MX record is required pointing to an Internet host for
forwarding.  The forwarding host must be directly on the Internet (that
is, have an IP addresss), no "double MX-ing" is allowed.

A group coordinator of, for example, the Computer Club in Chicago (CCC),
could arrange to coordinate the registration of all the computers used
by members of the club.  The registered names might have the form:

	PC37.CCC.CHI.IL.US   MX   10   CS.UOFC.EDU

Only hosts on the Internet can act as forwarding hosts.  Hosts on
systems such as CSNET, UUCP, BITNET, must be registered with an Internet
forwarding host.  When registering a destination host in the US domain
with an MX record, the requester is responsible for also registering the
destination host with the administrator of the forwarding host.  For
example, when an messages is sent to "Susan@PC37.CCC.CHI.IL.US" it will
be routed to the Internet host "CS.UOFC.EDU" as directed by the MX
record.  The host "CS.UOFC.EDU" must know some way of delivering the
message to the host "PC37.CCC.CHI.IL.US" (uucp, slip, whatever).  So the
destination host (PC37.CCC.CHI.IL.US) must be known to (registered with)
the forwarding host (CS.UOFC.EDU), as well as being registered in the
DNS database.

The administrator of the destination host must make an agreement with
the administrator of the forwarding host for the forwarding service.
This agreement must be in place before the request for registration is
sent to the US Domain Administrator.

A section of the DNS database is called a "zone".  With careful
coordination, a domain (like EDU) can be divided into several zones.
This has been done for the EDU and COM domains to aid in the
registration of hosts from the UUCP, CSNET and BITNET communities.  If a
host is registered in UUCP, BITNET, or CSNET zone (as something.EDU or
something.COM), it need not be registered in the US domain, unless a
geographical name (something.city.state.US) is desired.

It is the policy that a computer must have a single primary name, so it
should not be registered in both US and COM (or both US and EDU).  It is
possible to have "nicknames" for a brief period while a host name change
is in progress.
 
Wild card records are not currently allowed in the US domain.
 
The US domain is currently supported by four name servers:

VENERA.ISI.EDU, VAXA.ISI.EDU, HERCULES.CSL.SRI.COM, and NNSC.NSF.NET.

There is no cost for registering a host in the US domain.

Mockapetris, P., "Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities, and RFC-1035,

       US Domain Policy and Procedures - September 1988 (Revised)
       ----------------------------------------------------------
		Jon Postel / Ann Westine


1.  What is the US Domain and who is eligible to register?

        The US domain is a Top Level domain created for people in the
        United States who have computers at home, or small local
        corporations who would like to register their host
        geographically.  A large corporation with offices all over the
        world would probably want to register with .COM.

2.  How do you register a host in the US Domain?

        Send a message to the US Domain Registrar (Westine@ISI.EDU).
        She will send you a US Domain Questionnaire to fill out.

3.  How is the Naming Scheme set up for the US Domain and it's
    subdivisions?

        The US Domain is set up geographically, that is, states, cities,
        etc.  The state codes are those assigned by the US Postal
        Service, and the city codes are Western Union's "City Mnemonics"
        code that we will send to you.  Another alternative for the city
        code it to use the full name of your city.

        For example:  academ.hou.tx.us (or)
                      academ.houston.tx.us

4.  Who will administer the US Domain and its subdivisions?

        For now, the US Domain and all of its subdivisions (i.e.,
        states, cities etc.) are managed by the US Domain Registrar.

        The US Domain is just getting started and we want to be careful
        about what names get used and how control is allocated until
        some usage patterns are established.  We will run the servers
        for all the US domains.  At some future point we will hand off
        the administration of individual states to appropriate
        responsible people, probably in the state they administer.

5.  Can I manage a Domain Group?

        The organizer of a group (or "domain park") of users with
        individual hosts can help by acting as the coordinator of the
        group and forwarding all the information for the group to the US
        Domain Registrar.

        The explicit specific information for each host in the group
        must be provided.  And all fully qualified names must be unique.
        If your host is not directly on the internet an MX record is
        required pointing to an internet host for forwarding.

        For example:

           JOES-HOST.ACADEM.HOU.TX.US   MX   10   GAZETTE.BCM.TMC.EDU
           SAMS-HOST.ACADEM.HOU.TX.US   MX   10   GAZETTE.BCM.TMC.EDU

        Wild card records are not currently allowed in the US domain.

        If you want to keep tabs on user individual hosts in a certain
        group and to register them say under "Houston" in the TX.US
        domain, for example, JOES-HOST.ACADEM.HOUSTON.TX.US with
        "ACADEM" as the group you would be managing, this would be ok.
        But you can't manage all "HOUSTON" or all "TX", just your group.

6.  How will the US Domain affect hosts in UUCP, CSNET and BITNET Zones?

        If a host is registered in UUCP, BITNET, or CSNET Zone, it
        doesn't need to register in the US domain, unless it wants to be
        registered geographically.  Only hosts on the internet can act
        as forwarding hosts.  Hosts on systems such as CSNET, UUCP,
        BITNET, etc., must register their hosts with an internet host.
        This is necessary because when messages for your host arrive at
        the internet host it will need to know where to forward them.
        MX records are necessary.

7.  Can a host be in both the US Domain and another domain (like .EDU
    or .COM)?

        No.  A host should have a single name.  It is possible to have
        "nicnames" for a brief period while a host name change is in
        progress.

8.  What does it cost?

        Currently, there is no cost for registering in the US Domain.
