	Hi.  It seems to me that some of us still haven't understood
	that the domain naming scheme is strictly a naming scheme and
	has nothing to do with the routes that are actually used for
	data communication.  The fact that some hosts are in one domain
	(say EDU) and other hosts are in another domain (say COM) does
	not imply that data communicated between them has to be routed
	via some sort of gateway.  Whenever hosts share a communication
	scheme (that is, a protocol family like IP/TCP/SMTP) they
	should commuincate directly no matter what domain names they
	have.

This sure sounds nice.  In the ARPA Internet, it even makes sense.  I
wish it were also true in the dial-up phone world.

Consider what happens when you ask who TOPAZ.CC.Berkeley.EDU is on
the ARPA Internet.  We'll assume you know the address of the EDU
nameserver, rather than having to ask the local nameserver for it.
You query the EDU nameserver who Berkeley is, and get back a reference
to the Berkeley nameserver.  Then you ask it and get referred to the
CC nameserver at their computer center.  The CC server tells you the
internet address for TOPAZ.  In all you've queried 3 servers, and
perhaps 5 seconds have elapsed for 3 datagrams and 3 responses.

Now let's consider a UUCP host that needs to know who wants to
look up the same address.  Suppose we take the nameserver approach.
The basic operation on UUCP is sending mail.  (In fact, it's the
only operation that works everywhere on the net - file transfer
and remote execution only work if you have a direct connection,
and security constraints make them nearly useless anyway.)  So
you send mail to the EDU nameserver, get back a mail reply, send
mail to the Berkeley server, get back a mail reply, send mail to
the CC server, and get back a reply.  A piece of mail takes 1/2
hour to get delivered under ideal circumstances; some hosts have
to wait until night to be polled, and international links take a
couple of days to get through.  (And if a link is messed up for
one of any number of reasons, it's not uncommon for mail to sit
for 30-60 days waiting for the link to be fixed.)  Multiply these
figures by 6 and you'll get a minimum of 3 hours to find out who
TOPAZ.CC.Berkeley.ARPA is.  And this assumes there are nameservers
in all the right places working well, and provides no redundancy.
It also assumes there are nameserver gateways that are allowed by
DCA and who don't mind high volumes of traffic going through them.
It's clearly unacceptable for interactive use, and it's not really
workable for mail either, even with a cache (since there will be a
high rate of cache misses, each of which can delay your mail by a
day or more.)

The alternative is to use mail forwarding.  That is, you look in your
local database (sort of a cache) for a path, and if you don't have
one you forward the mail to your domain parent and hope they do.
Eventually you either pass the mail through someone who has a path
to the host, or who at least recognizes a part of the name and can
forward it to a gateway for that domain to deal with.

If you have a complete map of the world, you can pick a best path and
send the mail directly, no matter what domain the destination is in.
In fact, there exists an excellent least-cost path finding program called
pathalias that does this very nicely, given an accurate and complete
map of the world.  However, the domain structure was built around the
assumption that the world is growing too fast for any central map to
ever be up-to-date.  Such a map is also too large to have present on
every machine in the world.  (The current UUCP map is still flat.  It
has about 2000 hosts and is about 600 K bytes of ASCII text, including
contact information and connection information about each host.  This
is barely within our capabilities to maintain and distribute, and the
UUCP world is growing rapidly as cheap UNIX machines become available.
[HP had a $5,000 UNIX machine on display at UniForum last month!  IBM
PC's and clones are also capable of speaking UUCP.]  We are moving to
a domain structure to make the UUCP world manageable again, and don't
expect to have a complete map in any single place.)

If you assume there will be domain-style clusters of locally maintained
information, and that you have to do mail forwarding if you don't have
a full path available locally, then the forwarding will naturally be
tree based.  If there is no information present in the domain name about
what's on the ARPA Internet and what's not, there is no way to avoid
sending mail that originated on UUCP over an ARPANET link in the process.
And we have a constraint that says "no traffic that originates off the
ARPANET and terminates off the ARPANET can travel over the ARPANET."

Those of us on UUCP would really love to use TCP/IP and join the Internet.
There are even signs that the high expenses could be cut with developing
technology to a reasonable level.  But even if this new technology allowed
us to create a public TCP/IP network, we would be unable to gateway into
the ARPA Internet, because of concerns over military security.  As has
been seen with the ARPANET and MILNET, two disjoint TCP/IP networks just
don't work well.  When you add in the traffic origin constraints, I just
don't see how to make it work.
