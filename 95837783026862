	Assuming MIT isn't going to get more recent domain code on their
	machines, how should I kludge my code to know to expect this lossage and
	deal with it appropriately?  Should I use the part of the answer they
	gave me (without the NS records)?  That doesn't quite work because the
	authoritative bit isn't set.  Should I special case MIT as losing and
	pretend it gives authoritative no-answer messages?  I'd like to be
	liberal in what I accept, but I can't figure out how to do it.  (Fixing
	the machines at MIT would be better, of course.)


    We just yesterday installed a new version of the nameserver on our machines,
    Berkeley UNIX bind version 4.7.3, that is supposed to work better.  It would
    be interesting to know if it fixes the problems that you have pointed out.  We
    have very little understanding of how the program works, and are trying real
    hard to stay out of the hacking-of-somebody-elses-domain-code buisness.
    Originally we were going to wait for the official "released' version of bind,
    but it always seems to be just a few weeks away, so we gave up and just went
    ahead and installed the beta test version.

MIT: Sorry for the delay in cleaning out my mailbox.  Whatever is
running at MIT now (on alpha-bits, wheaties and grapenuts) is correctly
answering the questions that barfed before on PREP, HERMES and
HEPHASTEUS(sp?).  Thanks.

Namedroppers: The general question is still open: If I find other
machines that barf on :start-of-authority and :name-server records,
what should I do?
