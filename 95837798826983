&gt; Now, if this is a business whose registered internet name is enterprise
&gt; then to the internet community it is ENTERPRISE.COM.  That means, I
&gt; think, that the nodes might be named:
&gt; 
&gt;                      hosta.subnet0.enterprise.com
&gt;                      hostb.subnet0.enterprise.com
&gt;                      hostc.subnet1.enterprise.com
&gt;                      hostd.subnet1.enterprise.com
&gt;                      hoste.subnet2.enterprise.com
&gt; 
&gt; I also think it would be reasonable to name hosts a and b:
&gt; 
&gt;                      hosta.enterprise.com
&gt;                      hostb.enterprise.com
&gt; 
&gt; Now the question:  If all of the above is correct and valid, could one of
&gt; the nodes on subnet0 be named just enterprise.com and still have all of
&gt; the routing to other nodes work correctly?
 
Time to pull up the old soapbox...

NO! Naming was developed to make things easier for users, not managers. Why
should users care what subnet they are on? Why should they be forced to type
out long names when communicating with users on other subnets? Why should they
have to keep track of who is on which subnet?

Names should convey information which is useful to the user and should be as
convenient to use as possible. Sub-domains for divisions in different
geographic location might make a lot of sense. Or for different political
bodies (such as departments or divisions). That's because such divisions
provide information that is useful and memorable. And most traffic will be
within the local domain and not require entering any domain information by the
user.

Names have NOTHING to do with network topology or addressing. (Well, I realize
the problems with the inverse resolutions. But I'm on my soapbox, after all!)

For anyone silly enough to want to see a more complete elucidation of my
thoughts on naming, see the ESnet DECnet Naming Policy and Guidelines available
from the edwg directory on icaen.llnl.gov. While these were written for a
different naming system, I think the concepts are valid for the DNS. In fact,
my experience with DNS led to my volunteering to write the document.

Disclaimer: Don't take this too seriously. I just like to improve my typing
and probably don't really know anything useful about anything.
