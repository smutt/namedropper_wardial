I should preface what I say below with an admission that I have never
used a Chaosnet system, and therefore might be unfamiliar with some
important aspects of said systems.  Apologies in advance if this is so.

Regarding the issue of whether a numeric Chaosnet address should be
represented in the domain data base as a single octal number (5 or 6
digits), or as a pair of numbers ("host" and "subnet"), I think the main
issues here are (1) the number of entries at any given level of the data
base, and (2) the ease with which the information can be maintained.

If a typical Chaosnet tends to have many hundreds or thousands of hosts,
it probably isn't feasible to list them all directly under the CH-ADDR
node of the domain tree.  Trading depth for breadth -- by using at least
two levels -- seems to make much more sense from an operational point of
view.  On the other hand, if almost all Chaosnets are small affairs with
no more than about 100 hosts each, then a single level under CH-ADDR is
perfectly reasonable.  Again, I'm not familiar with Chaosnet and don't
know how big or small such systems normally are.

The original idea of using decimal numbers to identify the nodes of the
Chaosnet domain space was, of course, inspired by the IN-ADDR.ARPA
scheme.  In the ARPA Internet, both the use of decimal numbers and the
splitting up of addresses into 8-bit chunks were already well estab-
lished before the domain naming scheme was devised.  If the tradition
for Chaosnet addresses, on the other hand, is to express them in octal
-- and if no operational reason exists to split an address into two
8-bit pieces -- then nothing really says that this must be done for the
proposed CH-ADDR domains.

For that matter -- assuming for the moment that Chaosnet address should
be split into two levels for the sake of the domain tree -- the two
pieces needn't necessarily be ordered "low-order.high-order".  The main
reason for this funny order in the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain was that subnets
are a fact of life in the Internet (and we wanted to associate some in-
formation -- such as gateway names -- specifically with subnets rather
than hosts).  If subnetting is not common in the Chaosnet world, then a
"high-order.low-order" ordering might be just as suitable.  On the other
hand, other considerations being equal, it might be better for CH-ADDR
to use the same ordering as IN-ADDR after all -- so as not to confuse
people who must work with both domains.

How about splitting a 16-bit octal address into a 7-bit high-order part
and a 9-bit low-order part (i.e., three octal digits in each part)?
Thus, for instance, information on MIT's node number 13065 would be
found under the name "65.13.CH-ADDR.MIT.EDU" -- where "65.13" is derived
from the low-order part (octal 065) and the high-order part (octal 013),
with leading zeroes suppressed as is done for the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain.
The advantage of this method is that it would be easy for an adminis-
trator to set up the necessary names -- no translation from the familiar
octal into decimal would be required, and errors would be reduced.

Note, by the way, that the suppression of leading zeroes in the labels
makes sense in Internet addresses -- but need not necessarily be carried
over into Chaosnet addresses (except possibly to avoid confusing the
people who have to maintain CH-ADDR subdomains).  Thus, "065.013" could
be used instead of "65.13" -- provided that everyone agreed to use the
same convention in all CH-ADDR subdomains everywhere.  (Some UNIX enthu-
siasts might even favor putting leading zeroes on all the numbers to
emphasize that they are octal -- in keeping with the convention in C for
writing octal constants; I am *not* going to try to push this idea.)
