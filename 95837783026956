Paul:
    
    Actually, the problem turns out to be somewhat trickier. 

&gt; I don't understand why you worry about 2 packets per hour (one query,
&gt; one response).  Even if the rate goes up to 24 packets per hour when a
&gt; master is dead, this isn't much of an expense.

    The problem is that my server has to fire up a task to check on the
zone -- because my server has a huge memory image, that apparently still
takes a while.  And during that time my server is unavailable.  Even
if this is just a few seconds per zone, with 72 zones to backup, at
one check per hour per zone, that's reduced my availability by several
percent.  Checking a failed master every five minutes is worse.

&gt; The real cost is copying the zone.  Admittedly, it can get out of hand
&gt; if an administrator is making frequent changes to a large zone AND
&gt; creating a new serial number each time, but the fix is simple: just tell
&gt; the administrator to "batch" the updates with regard to updating the
&gt; zone on a master server, unless the change is really urgent.

    Transfering the zone is actually not so bad -- we fire up a separate
task that loads the zone into a file that our server reads when the task
completes.  The server can continue to answer queries after the task
is started (this is the same task mentioned above, it checks if the zone
needs updating and if so, does the transfer). We're working on optimizing
the loading stage in named (David Waitzman just did some tuning that appears
to have reduced the time needed to read a file by about 25%).

    The bottom line is that, once the number of zones you back up is high,
anything that perturbs your server's standard querying process is expensive.
Admittedly, bind probably still needs tuning to handle this problem better --
I'm working with what I've got.
