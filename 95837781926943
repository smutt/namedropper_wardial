	One thing I've been seeing more and more of these days are uses
	(especially inverse queries) of the domain system I consider gratuitious
	and wasteful. Here are some examples:
	 ...
	 ...

	In general, I think IP address -&gt; name translations should be avoided
	altogether by network daemons unless they are absolutely necessary for
	"real time" authentication purposes. This is the case with, e.g., rsh
	and rcp, but NOT with the regular ARPA network applications.
	
	Comments?

It seem to me that it is an important architectural principle of a good
communication system that the end users should never have to worry about/
think about/see low-level physical addresses like 32-bit numbers.  The
indirection provided by host names is also important operationally.  If
it (the indirection) really works, then site administrators can be free
to change IP addresses to meet their topology requirements, without
affecting the users at all.  If it doesn't work, we get silliness like
having more than one IP network number on the same cable, to avoid
changing IP addresses of hosts.

You are telling me that the domain system doesn't work very well.
Maybe we ought to admit this, understand why, and back off to try
again.  If this is computer science, we are allowed to fail.
But maybe it's not a failure of concept, but rather of engineering?
