    &gt;Suppose my cache has a timed out CNAME record for A.B.C and a
    &gt;non-timed-out HINFO record for A.B.C.

    I would think you would ignore the CNAME and treat the HINFO as valid.
    Note that if you have a CNAME you are not allowed to have anything
    else.  So we should assume the name used to be a CNAME but is now a
    real name, and the HINFO is from the real name.  Either that or we
    assume somebody is violating the RFC's.

Another person (privately) suggested I make the CNAME query (option 3). 
Well, one vote for option 1 and one vote for option 3.

Please point out how this violates the RFCs.  Because of the way
timeouts work, the following could produce this situation:
 -  I create a host whose RRs are good for 1 year.
 -  You ask about the HINFO of the host, and cache the RRs for 1 year.
 -  I decide to change the primary name of the host, and in hindsight
    decide that data should only be good for 1 day.
 -  You ask for some additional information about the host (e.g., WKS or
    something).  This time you get a CNAME that is good for 1 day.
 -  1 day passes.
 -  You want the HINFO again.  Well, now you have the situation I just
    postulated.
 -  If I just return the HINFO, it may be wrong, since in reality the
    name you are querying really is an alias.

I can also construct a scenario where just using the HINFO without
asking is correct. 

I don't see how this violates the RFCs.  What I do see is that there may
be design problems with timeouts and/or carving up objects into pieces
which then have separate timeouts.  

At any rate, can somebody point me to a place in the spec that says what
my implementation should really do, and also discuss (or acknowledge)
the scenarios that can lead to that course of action being technically
correct but perhaps being wrong as a reflection of the real world?
