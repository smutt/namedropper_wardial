Here are some examples of sites and organizations, and I hope this
clears up any confusion between the two, and why hosts are in sites and
how mailer systems could take advantage of that.  

A site is generally a collection of resources, such as computers and
printers.

MIT (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is an organization, and
in domain-land it is currently called MIT.EDU.  There are several parts
of MIT that are admistratively distinct, such as the Media Lab, the AI
lab, LCS (Laboratory for Computer Science), etc, and have names like
Media.MIT.EDU, AI.MIT.EDU and LCS.MIT.EDU.  These could be the names of
sites, but for a couple reasons (mostly delegation of authority) these
aren't.  As I said, sites are usually named c.c.d.e, so it is possible
to have a site named AI.AI.MIT.EDU which is the AI site of the AI Lab.
There might also be a ROBOT.AI.MIT.EDU site which is the site the
robotics people use.

A more geographic example is that of Symbolics the company, with a
domain-land name of Symbolics.COM.  In Cambridge there is the Symbolics
Cambridge Research Center (SCRC) which is domain-named
SCRC.Symbolics.COM.  Again, this level is more administrative than
site-level.  The site is would be called SCRC.SCRC.Symbolics.COM.  The
QA department inside SCRC might have a site named QA.SCRC.Symbolics.COM
and the VLSI people might be in the VLSI.SCRC.Symbolics.COM site.  The
names of machines in all these sites might have the form
name.SCRC.Symbolics.COM and wouldn't necessarily be burried under their
site name.  Additionally, there are sites in field offices and
California, perhaps with names like SGD.SWW.Symbolics.COM for the
Graphics Division in Westwood.

As I described before, sites are responsible for describing (and/or
having) mail delivery and/or forwarding machines for mail destined for
their site.  When mail is directed at a machine that doesn't support
mail (e.g., when somebody reverses a physical return path), the mailers
described by the machine's site take responsibility for the mail.
