    From: solomon@cs.wisc.edu (Marvin Solomon)

    My first reaction to recent discussion about this topic was that people
    were confusing "non-authoritative" with "useless".  

I'm not confused.  Non-authoritative means that the data may not be
complete or may be obsolete.  The local telephone book is
non-authoritative; directory information has the current data.  Useless
means that having it doesn't do me any good and may do me harm.  A
Brazilian phonebook won't help me call you.

    On reflection, I realized
    that real problem is how to deal with negative information, 

Noooo!!!  My real problem is trying to figure out when I have complete
information, whether or not it is authoritative.  There isn't a
"complete-information" bit in records, so the best I seem to be able to
do is overload the "authoritative-answer" bit.

    and decided
    that the "right" solution is to introduce a new feature for replies:
    "negative resource records".

Doesn't help.  If I ask somebody for an address record and get one back,
how do I know there is just the one or if there are three?

    Consider David Plummer's scenario:

Feel free to use my scenario, but please note that you aren't answering
my questions with it.

    +---------------+
    | Workstation   |               +---------------+
    |w/ local cache |&lt;=============&gt;|               |
    +---------------+               | Site resolver |
				    |      aka      |
	    ...                     |Site Nameserver|&lt;===&gt; Big-I Internet
				    |               |
    +---------------+       RD-&gt;    |recursion avail|
    | Workstation   |&lt;=============&gt;|cache for site |
    |w/ local cache |   &lt;-RA, AA?   +---------------+
    +---------------+

    To summarize his discussion, he asks whether the authoritative bit
    should be set in responses by the site resolver to workstations
	    (1) when the answer is the result of recursion
	    (2) when the information comes from its cache.
    He concludes that (1) should be authoritative and considers 3 answers
    for case (2):
	    Authoritative
	    Non-authoritative
	    Don't use the cache (obviously silly).

    I think the solution is to realize that it isn't the information (RR's)
    that is authoritative or not; rather, it is the *absence* of RR's.
It's both, really.
    That's why the authoritative bit applies to a response, not to an
    individual RR.  
So far, so good.
    If I send an MX query to a server and get back an
    authoritative response with NOERROR but an empty answer section,
    I can conclude the name has no MX records.
Yup.
    If the answer isn't authoritative,
    I can't conclude anything about MX records.
Yup.
    But if I do get back RR's, I should believe them, authoritative or not.  

You should believe them, but unless authoritative is on, should you
believe you got all of them?  Suppose the site resolver had 3 records,
but two of them timed out and the authoritative server didn't answer.
The site resolver at best can only return the one non-timed-out record.
You can believe it, but it isn't all the information.

    (The 'authority' concept was not designed to track down and kill
    bogus information!) 

I would debate both whether or not that was the design, and whether or
not that should be the design.  Personally, I think if I get
authoritative data, it should remove RRs that match the same question
but aren't also represented in the authoritative answer.

    Most cache designs, however, simply cache RR's, losing their grouping
    into responses, and hence losing negative information.  There have
    been various proposals lately for "negative caching", but they
    haven't extended to "negative answers".

Negative answers don't provide for grouping.  They provide for positive
indications that there is no data.  This looks to be the same as an
answer of length zero.

    Hence my modest proposal:
    Provide a way to flag a RR as being "negative", for example
	    FOO.BAR.EDU MX --NONE--
    (I don't really mean to use "--NONE--" as a reserved value; some other
    encoding of negative RR's should be devised.)  Such entries can be
    entered in a cache in response to *absence* of positive counterparts
    in an authoritative response, AND CAN BE RETURNED IN ANSWERS.

It looks you are moving the "There is no data" concept from being a
property of the query to a property of the data.  In the implementation
I'm working on, I'm putting in the ability to remember that there was no
answer without having to represent it with data.

    In the above scenario, the site server *never* returns authoritative 
    responses to the workstations (except for information about local names).
    However, when it receives the first query about a name not in its cache, it
    relays the query to an authoritative server, and caches both positive
    and negative information.  The workstation shouldn't care that
    it gets non-authoritative responses so long as it gets the information
    it wants.

The information it wants is complete information.  If a host has three
addresses, I want all three addresses.  If the site resolver can only give
me one, I want to know that that is not complete.  If the site resolver
gives me all three, I want to know that it is complete.  I cannot
express that with a --NONE-- RR.

    There remains the problem of assigning a time to live to such generated
    negative RR's.  This problem as been discussed at length in this group,
    and I have little to add, except to point out that if the authoritative
    server returns negative RR's, it can assign appropriate TTL's as
    it chooses.

I agree they are related.  Generally, we all seem to be agreeing that
the TTL is an attribute of the answer, not the data in the answer.  (The
lifetime of the data in the authorities and addition fields is another
issue.)

    Finally, this disussion also helps answer a question posed in another
    message from David Plummer:  How do we convey the information that
    a name does not correspond to any host?  My response is another
    question:  Why would anybody care?  

Because there is a difference between non-existent hosts and unreachable
hosts.  Some systems want to distinguish between the two.  If a host
exists but is unreachable, other properties about the host may give me
leads on who to contact in order to make it be reachable.  Most of the
DECnet hosts in the world exist but are unreachable because DECnet
doesn't yet have a widespread geteway system like the Internet does.
That doesn't mean the host doesn't exist.

    If I want to know whether the
    name is useful as a mail destination, whether I can connect to it
    via IP, or whether it is a VAX, I can look for MX, IN A, or HINFO
    records, respectively.  If I want to know whether I can connect to it
    at all, I have to look for class=X address rescords for all classes
    I know or care about.  Wildcard queries help me find out such info
    from an authoritative server without playing "twenty questions".
    Negative RR's help me get such info from non-authoritative servers.

I generally agree, and repeat that more complete cache management would
also allow the same information as negative RRs provided the site
resolver were allowed to answer authoritatively questions that are exact
copies of previous questions and the associated answer data hasn't timed
out.
