I think I can shed some light on the MILNET/DNS problem from somewhat
of an "inside" perspective.  Our group has done a fair amount of
Internet consulting for MILNET sites, converting a lot of places from
a single MILNET host to an internetted LAN with site gateways, etc.,
and we have always warned people (starting several years ago) about
the need to convert to DNS.  We have been successful in some cases
(e.g., the US European Command, where we converted their new
sites to DNS and I am still, I think, the Technical/Zone contact for 
EUCOM.MIL), but not in others.   

There are a couple of main reasons for the problems Karl brings up:

1. Among the military services themselves (the largest group of
non-DNS-capable MILNET sites), there is a total lack of Internet
expertise. (I'm talking about the actual subscriber sites, not DCA).
There is virtually *no* networking expertise there at all beyond things
like PC networks, Novell, etc., and simple UNIX TCP/IP LANs or DECNet
LANs that don't have to worry about the Internet.  All the rest of the
expertise somes from contractors and outside consultants.  Part of this
is due to the way the military runs; part is due to the fact that until
recently DOD was almost totally reliant on a single vendor for Internet
requirements -- BBN.  (This is not meant to denigrate BBN -- I have
worked with a number of fine technical people from BBN both in the DCA
sites and in the field.)

2. Among military contractors on MILNET there is the attitude that DDN
and the Internet only exists for them to communicate with DOD program
sponsors, and that internetting (and all the Good Stuff that goes with
it, like DNS) is not something that needs to be encouraged and nurtured
for its own sake.  For contractors on cost-plus-profit and
system-support contracts, if DNS conversion was not in the specs, it
doesn't get done.  For other contractors, who are in more of a
consulting role, DNS conversion gets greater encouragement.

The bottom line is, when it is absolutely required to be DNS-capable
to be on MILNET, people will convert to DNS.  And probably not before,
unless someone is talented enough to convince people that it has to be
done.
