Well, the last suggestion didn't stir up too much.  This one's
more exciting and probably more realizable:

A problem with the domain system is that of managing the domain server
files.  If you maintain one of these for a fair sized domain, then you
know what it's like to be the NIC.  People are always changing things
and adding new machines, and you have to edit zone files every few
days to make the changes.  Wouldn't it be nice if the data was really
distributed?

So, we add a command to the domain server.  The command allows a host
to send to a server a list of RRs for itself to be entered into the
domain server's database (and to a permanent copy on disk).  Now
imagine a domain server for domain C.B.A that was just started.  It
has no data except maybe a few pre-wired RR's for gateways and such.
A host D.C.B.A comes up.  It resolves C.B.A and gets the address of
it's domain server.  It then send off a list of RRs to the domain
server and now it's registered.  If the host administrator decides to
change the name or address of D.C.B.A he just runs some program that
replaces the current RRs in the server.

This scheme effectively distributes the data right down to the
source, eliminates the need to have someone edit zone files and such,
and makes instantaneous changes real easy.

The hard part might be authentication of requests.
