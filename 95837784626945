    Yes, they "should". I don't think there has been any serious disagreement
with that.

&gt;It may not be possible for them to do that ... unfortunately.

  That is PRECISELY the point! Read on...

&gt;I don't
&gt;know how their stuff is implemented at ucar, but they might not have
&gt;enough "talent" to manage lots of gateways all over the country.

   They don't have *any* talent. At least, none that has Internet access.
Their "stuff" at ncar is implemented by just using pathalias output and
smail to route to fidonet.org. A trivial addition to a hook that already
exists in my sendmail.cf file. Software many of us use and are familiar with.
Nothing mysterious about it. A fidonet.org address comes in, it gets handed
off to smail, and that's all there is to it here at ncar.
   The way they've done it now, they only have to contact ONE PERSON on the
Internet (i.e. me). To do it the way they "should" do it would not only
require dozens of MX records, it would also require contacting dozens of
people on the Internet and get them to agree to forward for them. This is
many orders of magnitude more difficult. It's just not PRACTICAL for them
to do that.
  The real question is, should they be allowed to operate this way? I saw
nothing in the current specs that forbids it, and it was trivial for me to
implement, so I agreed to help them. So far, the only arguments I have seen
against it are religious in nature, sort of the flip side of the "is aggressive
rerouting a good thing" argument that we've all seen many times.
  My current plan is to keep on doing this until either aggressive rerouting
becomes so common that I can't do it any more without a lot of maintenance
(marking too many sites dead, etc.) or if someone presents me with a better
argument than "I should be able to do aggressive rerouting if I want to".
