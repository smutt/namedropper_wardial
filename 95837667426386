Regarding Larry Peterson's message:

	Thanks for the explanation.

No problem.  If there are any errors in it, I trust someone will speak
up and set things straight.

	Next question:  I haven't heard any discussion on either the
	time table for the IN-ADDR domain (RFC 921 only refers to con-
	verting programs that do host --&gt; addr mappings by 5-15-85), or
	the exact partitioning of the IN-ADDR domain into zones.

I don't believe there has been any such discussion (at least, not pub-
licly).

Further, I seriously wonder whether the 15-May-85 deadline for programs
to use the servers for host-to-address mapping is actually going to hold
or not.  (This is less than six weeks away.)  Hopefully someone "in the
know" can clarify whether this one is going to happen on schedule or
"slip" like the other various and sundry transition deadlines have.

	The second question [partitioning IN-ADDR into zones] is signif-
	icant because it directly affects the way local administrators
	go about adding new hosts or nets to the Internet; the name to
	address bindings can be handled in the local zone/name server,
	but who is responsible for the inverse binding?

	In other words, rather specific rules have been laid out regard-
	ing the implementation of the name to address part of the domain
	heirarchy; do the same rules govern the IN-ADDR domain?

	If my organization implements the local zone for host names,
	does it also implement a zone for the locally used class B and C
	networks?

It would seem reasonable, I suppose -- and, let me emphasize, this is
just a suggestion, since I have no authority in this matter -- for the
IN-ADDR domain to be split up into zones at the network level, and for
each zone to be maintained by the people responsible for the correspond-
ing network.
