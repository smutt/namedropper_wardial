John,

I finally was able to reach Klaus kuhn today by phone or i should say he called
me back today.  He says he can't get rooms for the week of the 18th because
the ADSIA plenary sessions are being helh that week. I suggested that we hold
the meetings that week in London a la the Ad Hoc meeting.  He didn't object to
that but he pointed out that we would not meet with SG/9 this time if we met
then.  So i have sent a net note off to Trevor to see if he can get Mike Bailley
to set up a room and get a translator(interpeter) for us.  I suspect i woun't
here from Trevor before Thursday.  Klaus wanted me to let him know by the end
of the week what I am able to arrange.

Klaus said that the SG/9 chairman (Tony) was planning to attend the next SG/9
meeting and bring alond another UK fellow who he plans to nominate for his 
replacement.

I think that i will send another note to trevor suggestring that the SG/9 meeting
alos be held in London the same week since Klaus was concerned that we would
not have a chance to meet again with SG/9 until Novenber or October.

Will keep you informed.

frank
