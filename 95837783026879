I have read the recent comments on directory services with great interest
and as a European who has been following the developments of X.500 closely
(although not actually participating) you might find my viewpoint
interesting.

X.500
-----
X.500 will be the first ISO/CCITT international standard for Directory Services
and is due to be accepted this year. The standard is defined by 7 sections
giving detailed descriptions of protocols, services etc. I believe that
X.500 will be a good first standard and although the following comments
point out several missing areas they are not to be taken as an "assassination"
attempt.

Yes X.500 is an attribute-based naming service and from some points of view
could be described as flexible. It allows more flexibility in
the definiton of information types than the arpa domain naming scheme allows
and includes mechanisms for defining the structure of the name space and of
directory information (schemas) which will be useful if the directory is
really to operate on a global scale.

My feeling is that although many claims have been made by researchers
about the role of X.500 in supporting many different communications services
(and even future services such as for "group communication") the design
has been mainly influenced by electronic mail considerations.
This has resulted in a fundamentally sound name server but it is not clear
whether the DS will meet more complex requirements. Immediate drawbacks are:

	Lack of an access control mechanism (it was in a previous version
		but dropped due time pressures - it should reappear in the 
		next standard)
	Lack of facilities to dynamically define new attribute and entry
		types (i.e. new schemas)
	Lack of support for management of the system itself 
		(e.g. tools to atomatically reconfigure the system as
		servers come and go)

X.500 has not totally ignored these problems - they are for future study.


Management services
------------------

More generally, X.500 does not support any relational features allowing
the expression and manipulation of the relationships between network
entities. I feel that the reason for this is that the technical problems in
building such a system have not been solved. This functionality must be
included in some system (not necessarily the DS) if future services are to be 
supported. For example: 

	How can we represent groups, entities and the relationships between 
	them?

	How do we manage LANs with complex many-many relationships between
	users, groups, hosts etc.?

	How do we name "objects" such as documents and conferences as
	well as communication entities? 

I am not saying that all of this belongs in the DS, however there is some
link between such requirements and a global naming service and researchers
should re-examine the DS in the context of more general management
and distributed naming problems.


Relationship to the Arpa world
------------------------------

The above is not intended to rip X.500 to pieces, it is only my opinion
of where future research must head. X.500 may provide a sound international
standard (and this is what we need if we want interconnection) and the
RFC group should pay very close attention to what X.500 has to say.
In fact, if it were not to late, I would like to see them accept X.500
instead of producing their own standard and attempt to build an 
implementation because what we really need is
experience which can be put back into the next ISO/CCITT study period.

Other projects
--------------

There are a number of European projects in this area which may provide
you with useful information.

	1. The Thorn project (large scale joint European effort)

	2. RARE (European implementors working group)

For more information on these talk to Steve Kille (steve@cs.ucl.ac.uk)

I can also supply a number of papers and further opinions
on this area on request.
