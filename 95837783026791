There are three servers for the AI.MIT.EDU, named PREP, HERMES and
HEPHAESTUS (all .AI.MIT.EDU).  If I ask these hosts a question about
AI.MIT.EDU or about hosts under that name, for which they have an
answer, they answer with the correct data, authoritatively, correctly
formatted, etc, etc.  If I ask a question for a name that doesn't exist,
I correctly get a NAME-ERROR reply.

However, if I ask them a question for which they don't have an answer,
each host does the following rather strange thing.  It replies with a
rather long UDP datagram (e.g., 388 bytes).  Using the rules in the
specification to parse this reply, one gets a header and one question.
There are 0 answers, 0 authorities and 0 additional.  This takes up a
small (e.g., 31 bytes) of the datagram.  That's bug#1: the parsing
doesn't match the length of the datagram.

The answer is also non-authoritative.  Bug#2, since each machine is
authoritative for the question.

If I parse the rest of the message as if it were supposed to be RRs, I
get a large number of RRs that exactly fill out the datagram.  That's
bug#3.

They are all :NAME-SERVER records.  My guess is that they were intended
to go in the authorities section.  Bug#4: The n-authorities field in the
header was not updated.  Bug#5: There should be some :ADDRESS RRs in the
additionals section.

The name-server RRs divide into
 3 RRs for ai.mit.edu (each with a TTL of 3 hours)
 5 RRs for mit.edu (each with a TTL of 2 days)
 7 RRs for the root (each good for 3.2 years (bug#6).
Bug#7: I asked it about things in AI.MIT.EDU, so why is it telling me to
go ask the same set of machines again?

As far as I can tell, each machine has the same behavior.  I have a
memory that they have been doing this for a long (&gt;18 months) time.  I
don't know what domain code they are running, how old it is, why it is
still so broken, etc, etc.

Here are some of the questions it barfs on:
	AI.AI.MIT.EDU	:START-OF-AUTHORITY
	AI.AI.MIT.EDU	:NAME-SERVER
It does not barf on asking ai.ai.mit.edu for CANONICAL-NAME.  This is
leading me to suspect that it is really these domain tree traversing
records (SOA and NS) that are ill-implemented.  My domain code really
wants to have authoritative versions of those records (or authoritative
knowledge that they don't exist).  

Assuming MIT isn't going to get more recent domain code on their
machines, how should I kludge my code to know to expect this lossage and
deal with it appropriately?  Should I use the part of the answer they
gave me (without the NS records)?  That doesn't quite work because the
authoritative bit isn't set.  Should I special case MIT as losing and
pretend it gives authoritative no-answer messages?  I'd like to be
liberal in what I accept, but I can't figure out how to do it.  (Fixing
the machines at MIT would be better, of course.)
