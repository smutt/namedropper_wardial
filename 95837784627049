  I am running BIND 4.8 on a Sun 4/280 running SunOS 4.0.1 . It is an 
authoritative primary server for our domain (ucar.edu) and associated
in-addr.arpa domains, and secondary for a number of other domains.
  We have a machine (scdsw1.ucar.edu) which is dead and buried. I have removed
all entries for it from our boot files (I've double and triple checked that 
this is truly the case, and restarted the server several times just to be sure).
The problem is, somehow the A record for that machine keeps coming back into
the cache. And once it does, our server begins handing out the data for this
nonexistent machine as an authoritative server! 
  It is obvious that the only way this RR can get into the cache is if
some other server still has the data in its cache and/or boot files. The 
question is: why does the server start broadcasting this data with the
authority bit set? It seems to me that the ONLY data that should EVER be
sent out with the authority bit set is data that comes from the boot files.
I assume that the reason this happens is because the information is about a
host in a domain for which this server is authoritative. But I still think
that is a dangerous security hole.
  Next question: why is this data ever being sent to our server in the first
place, and is there any way to find out who is sending it? I can be sure that
our server never explicitly asks for this data; if I query the server 
immediately after restarting, it returns NXDOMAIN, just as it should.
  Lastly, if this data is in YOUR server's cache, please flush it. One thing
of note is that this machine, a year or two ago, USED to be the primary
server for our domain. So USAN members especially please check and ensure
that you have no data for scdsw1.ucar.edu in your name server boot files.
The proper primary server for ucar.edu is now handies.ucar.edu (128.117.64.4)

Thanks for any hints anyone can give.
