It seems the correct compromise here is for UUCP to be one toplevel
domain, based strictly on naming authority (which happens to agree
with communication protocol), but to allow the UUCP administration to
develop subdomains which are geographical and which are in fact used
as default routing mechanisms within UUCP.

Thus each UUCP sub-domain would have its own nameservers and maintain
its own host table which is copied to all hosts in that subdomain, and
also the toplevel UUCP domain would maintain a subdomain table which is
distributed to all hosts in all subdomains as well as to Arpanet and
other domains. Messages within a subdomain would use the resident copy
of the subdomain routing table to route optimally. Messages across a
subdomain boundry would use the main UUCP routing table to jump the
message through major gateway nodes into the correct subdomain, after
which delivery would reduce to the within-a-subdomain case. Such
cross-subdomain messages wouldn't be absoutely optimally routed, but
would be close to it.

I think this idea satisfies the tecnicalities of the domain system
while keeping both Arpa and UUCP happy. Any rebuttal to this idea?
