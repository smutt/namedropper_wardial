Over recent months, I have seen several proposals/analyses for giving
users a way to traverse the domain tree.  Since it does not sound, so far,
as if any have gained immediate acceptance, I wonder if we should consider
the question of point of view.

The proposals, including Plummer's, have attempted to give users full
tree-traversal power.  Obviously, one cannot criticize this goal.  The
tree is there.  It needs to be traversed.  If you limit the ability, you
will find users who are stymied.

Unfortunately, most users, most of the time, get lost with complexity and
too much power.  An "average" user puts little time into learning; s/he
has a job to do and constantly learning and analysing a mail system, text
editor, etc. are not tasks that they get rewarded for.

If we want domain name specification to be easily learned and processed by
average users, we must keep to a few, very simple rules.  I'd like to say
that I know what those rules should be, but the best I can offer at the
moment are a few suggestions:

1.  A user may specify a complete domain name.  Having a period at the
end seems like a reasonable trick to distinguish relative, versus absolute,
specifications.  This one rule means that users always can get to any leaf
on the tree.  

Any additional rules are for convenience, so we must balance the convenience
of keystrokes against the conveniences of guessing which keys to push.

Two types of convenience opportunities look as if they will be common
for users:

	A.  Intradepartment, where A.Engr.Company.Com needs to send to
	    B.Engr.Company.Com, and

	B.  Interdepartment, where A.Engr.Company.Com needs to send to
	    to B.Mktg.Company.Com.

There is a peculiar case where A.Mktg.Company.Com needs to send to
B.WRegion.Mktg.Company.Com, but I suspect that the structure ought to
have the first name be A.HQ.Mktg.Company.Com.

(My list is biased, but any list will be.  To the extent that there
are objections to the suggestions in this note, I'd like to request that
the focus be upon generating example specification situations that we
are trying optimize.)

Both A and B are handled by the rule:

2.  A user specification which does not end in dot is relative to the
user's own domain name.  Each field of the user specification replaces
one field from that domain string.  (The "peculiar case" therefore is not
handled.)

That's all.

There is some chance that users can juggle these two rules, although
the second one has enough complexity to be bothersome.

As to the questions of separator character and direction of specification,
these seem like straightforward human factors.  If we are concerned about
making the "best" choices, then we need to run some tests with "typical"
users to find out which character and which direction they learn the
easiest and can generate and comprehend the quickest.  My vote is to
keep the period and keep the right-hand anchor.  But, then, I'm not
a typical user.
