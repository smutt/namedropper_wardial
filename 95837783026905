Larry, I'm glad you received the X.500 documents I sent but you
should give them a more complete reading.  A tremendous amount
of work has gone into the X.500 work as I'm certain has also 
gone into your work.

Your message today made several false statements;  probably the
most troubling is the statement listed in goal 1, reading:
     "1) X.500 is an improved X.400, and X.400 is a slightly more 
	 flexible alternative to the domain system. (Question: Does
	 X.400 go away when X.500 is in place?) ..."
The X.400 recommendation is for Message Handling Systems (MHS) while
the X.500 recommendation is for Directory Services.  In '88 it is
assumed that X.400 systems may use X.500 systems for a variety of
services but the fact remains that they are different recommendations
which provide for different services.

It should also be pointed out that Steve Kille's quoted message went
on to indicate the much of the work not addressed in the current
recommendation will be resolved within that framework over the 
next study period.  Producing solutions is certainly a priority for
the standards groups developing the X.500 recommendations.

Again, it will be very helpful if your work is to address its 
interaction and coexistence with the X.500 Directory service since
it seems like your are addressing the problem of naming many, if
not all, of the same objects.  Developing yet another naming/addressing
protocol island won't help anyone in either the short or the long
run.

  - Chris
