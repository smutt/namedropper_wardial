We are just gearing up for using bind 4.8 in anger here at U.Q. and
I find myself bemoaning the top-level domain set.

Ok: the Internet is predominantly a U.S. oriented beast, but does it
*really* make sense to promote such "useful" triglyphs as .edu .gov .org 
.com to "top level" status? I can see a case for the last two, since orgs 
and companies are truly international in spirit, but .edu and .gov and .mil
really don't cut it. -There are many entities which one might wish to
address as thing.gov, and in "fairness" to all of them surely the U.S. ones
could have accepted being qualified by a .us?


	(1)	you shouldn't really have "similar" domain-names
		occurring at two consecutive levels in a name

	(uk experience suggests this is painful see uk.ac.co and uk.co)

	(2)	if .gov is a top-level domain and you wish to institute
		a .gov.&lt;country&gt; domain you can *never* use partially
		specified names safely

	(3)	one day (my prince will come...) the net is going to be
		"more" than just a US socio-economic-military complex
		tool and become global infrastructure.  -Will the U.N.
		have to live with the state-of-amerika having userped 
		the .gov domain? (1/27th :-)

Australia has .edu.au and we'll soon be in direct contact with y'all 
there in the big country. will anything break? anybody assuming *.edu
means "all academic" rather than "all academic in the .edu top domain"?


	
so:
	how many beasts will there *really* be that are globally designated
	as domains?

	will OSI-aligned networks be "accepting" .gov .mil .org or
	will they be co-erced into /C=US/ADMD=ORG/ form?

PS bind4.8 is lovely. if only the MB and MR and MG were not "experimental"
(sigh) anyone got any code that uses 'em yet?
