I think that the "It would break existing code" argument is about the
worst reason to prohibit 3Com.COM from being a legal domain name.
There certainly is precident for breaking existing code in the name of
"progress," and laziness or bad programming habits is no excuse for not
doing the right thing ... (c.f., 14-character filenames?).

In 4BSD, the function inet_addr(3) does a really thorough job of
determining whether an address is specified as a legal dotted IP
address, and it's worth looking at if you write code that interfaces to
the resolver.

----- new angle on the subject ...

I think the thing that most people are missing in this whole discussion
about where things "fit" in the domain namespace, is the fact that
things like "Berkeley.EDU" or "NASA.GOV" or "IBM.COM" are really just
redundant.

Why do I need to to "tag" my domain in order to explain that NASA is a
Government Agency?

Shouldn't the top-level domains be more descriptive organizationally?

As an example, it seems that there are largely two types of networks
these days. The first, and presently most common, is the LAN with one
connection to the Internet, such as UC Berkeley.  The whole site is
self-contained, and so the now-near-famous addage "Names should not
imply routes" has fallen apart.  Certainly, just from looking at the
hostname "gadzooks.Berkeley.EDU" one can infer that this local part
"gadzooks" is on the 128.32 Class B IP network and can be reached
through the Berkeley-PSN.

The other flavor, and the one which is growing in popularity among the
corporate world, but certainly is not unfounded in the academic world,
is that of the so-called "swamp model" of clusters of networks, some of
which may have multiple connections to the Internet. Examples include
DEC.COM, ATT.COM and soon, NASA.GOV.

Even the University of California is busy off making their own internal
network, which will eventually connect together all 9 UC Campusses,
including the presently Internet-connected sites Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Berkeley and Irvine along with the other
non-Internet campusses, Santa Cruz, Davis, Riverside and Santa Barbara
(SB was originally on the ARPANET way back when, but I bet we'll see
them return).

What we get then are parallel sets of networks with multiple gateways
into *administrative* domains ... it's always bothered me that the
domain model asserts that the parent of each sub-tree is *responsible*
for the sub-tree below it, even though there was no "responsible
administrative entity" that could prove itself to actually *be*
responsible for sub-trees like "COM" -- is there a group that would
"police" both IBM and DEC at the same time?  Should there be?

You're all shouting at your terminals right now, "THE NIC IS
RESPONSIBLE" which, in a certain sense (that of the NIC acting through
DCA and ultimately DARPA's wishes in the `protocol police' area), but
now that domains don't imply IP connectivity (and thus, some sort of
DCA control), I can't see how the tag "COM" makes any sense at all ...

I would propose that Administrative Entities get their own top-level
domains, and *use* them ... for instance, it seems rather silly for the
common parent of Berkeley, UCI, UCSD and UCLA (and now UCSC) to be
"EDU" (or "Educational Entities") instead of The University of
California.

Why is there Berkeley.EDU, UCI.EDU, UCLA.EDU, UCSD.EDU, UCSC.EDU
instead of Berkeley.UCal, Irvine.UCal, LosAngeles.UCal, SanDiego.UCal,
SantaCruz.UCal etc.???

What makes the "organizational" relationship between Berkeley-&gt;UCLA
different from Berkeley-&gt;MIT such that a more reasonable granularity
isn't possible?

I claim this will also help us think more about how it is we want to
structure the *semantics* of an address in the coming years.  With
X.400, etc. just around the corner (if they can, as Jon Postel echoed,
figure out what to have for breakfast :-), something like

	Jordan.Hayes@Mechanical.Engineering.Berkeley.UCal

winds up translating very well into some sort of "common denominator"
addressing scheme that approaches the ultimate goal of being usable,
functional, logical and above all, meaningful, while maintaining both
the spirit and the letter of the original designers.

If you change the order, and substitute `\n' for the `.', that winds up
looking an awful lot like

	Jordan Hayes
	Department of Mechanical Engineering
	College of Engineering
	University of California, Berkeley

Also, the semantics of the system would begin to make sense.  Take, for
example, the mythical case of the Internal parallel network owned by
the University of California, linking all 9 campusses (not too far
away, and not at all different from the plans of other schools, such as
SUNY, the Virginia University Schools, some things I've heard about the
Wisconsin and Minnesota schools, not to mention multi-national
corporations such as IBM, DEC, etc. and certainly the Government
branches), and given an address like the above -- now there really is a
way to talk to the top level nameservice provider, as well as (if the
message is coming from a disconnected network, such as CSNet or UUCP)
simply handing it off to any UCal gateway, be it at Los Angeles, San
Diego or what have you.

So many people in the non-IP world (and a few of us Arpanauts as well)
ask the question ``Where is the EDU nameserver?'' ... *grrr*

Is there a reason why the top-level domains have to be *explicit* to
the point of obscuring the intent and functionality of it?  Why can't
this simply be a software issue?  I understand the need for the domain
names to be *rooted* but can't the end of the string signify the root?
Some people were even suggesting back then that we have a trailing dot
to explicity specify the route.  Geepers.

This also leads to a cleaner solution to the National top-level (i.e.,
UK) -- those situations where the country really is the adminstrative
owner of the sub-trees below (European PTT's come to mind here) should
certainly be rooted with the country name or ISO initials ... while
leaving a place like the good old USA alone and away from that vague
and unenforcable issue ...
