It seems to me that there are two cases:

	1) How to get to one of the interfaces on a distant host

Having the nameserver preserve order (JEEVES and BIND seem to already
do this, but does it happen on purpose?) should solve this one, if
network administrators give the ordering precidence to the "outside
world".  This may run into a snag where there are hosts that are on
multiple IMPs ... of which there doesn't seem to be many (maybe some
machines at BBN and SRI, and they can expect to lose anyways :-)

	2) How to get to an interface on a LAN

Who cares? On a long-haul net, the extra hop can often be the
difference between connecting or not, but on a local LAN, is there
anyone out there who is having congestion problems of note?  On a
related note, how many people out there have more than say 20 sub-nets
locally? At Berkeley, I think we have about 25-28 allocated, but a
bunch of them aren't on-line yet. I'm told we're to have tons more at
some later date, but it's unclear what will be done at that point.

If you set up your network so that it's hard to get to you, you also
deserve to lose. The main problem I see (which isn't quite upon us yet)
is the question of parallel networks with multiple gateways ...  this
could become a question with NSFnet, and/or something like the UCDLA
project. I don't think there's anybody presently that has a network
with multiple (physically distant, both in miles and network
connectivity) connections to the Internet.

Although a valid question to be asked, I think the local issue is
handled with *far* less overhead if you use extra routes for the
problems rather than some configuration file  -- most multiply-homed
hosts tend to be centrally located in a LAN, so most won't need extra
routes. Is this wishful thinking, or does anyone out there have a
different experience?
