I poked around with the inverse query mechanism on a few machines.
References pages 17 and 18 of RFC 883.

One thing I tried is to inverse query a nameserver asking it about
itself.  That is:
	opcode = IQUERY
	answer = &lt;noname&gt; NS IN &lt;host namelist&gt;

When I tried XX.LCS.MIT.EDU a few days ago, it worked.  It told me about
the various zones inside IN-ADDR.ARPA that it servers, as well as
LCS.MIT.EDU and Proteon.COM.

When I tried SRI-NIC.ARPA I got an rcode=NOT-IMPLEMENTED.

When I tried BITSY.MIT.EDU (which serves MIT.EDU) I got a rcode=REFUSED.
Shouldn't this be NOT-IMPLEMENTED (as mentioned in the last paragraph on
page 17), or is it really trying to tell me if I were more trusted it
might tell me?

I also tried some inverse queries by address.  Again, XX.LCS.MIT.EDU
when I asked it to IQUERY its own address responded correctly (modulo
filling in the namelist for the answer field like the example on page 18
shows.  (It did include the namelist in the question, so that was good
enough.)  When I asked BITSY.MIT.EDU to IQUERY BITSY's address, it
didn't say REFUSED this time but returned no answers, even though BITSY
is authoritative for its own address!
