	I supose it doesn't make any difference what a netw.adm. at a Swedish
	University says in this debate, but still it needs to be said:

Au contraire, I think that the problems experienced by the more
international community pose the real unknowns left to us (below).

	What has caused problems, though, is sending mail to domains within
	Europe, where the DNS often gives us to a host somewhere in the US,
	while we possibly should hand the mail to some host here in Europe.
	Even worse - we might get the address of a host in Europe, which we
	either can't reach at all (usually the US can't reach it either!)
	or we are not allowed to connect to.

Given that the only hosts you are directly connected to are in the
US, getting a US MXer isn't so bad.  But this reflects what typically
happens: the US serves as the core for int'l traffic.  As Christian
pointed out some weeks ago, when he (or I) send mail to DEC-PRL
(Paris Research Labs), the mail feels compelled to go to DEC-WRL
en route (that's 22,400km -- if I had a "frequent-mailer" program,
I could earn tickets to an IETF in Hawaii or Cocoa Beach).  For both
of us, we have full IP connectivity to DEC-PRL.  For administrative
reasons (I assume), there are no MX records specific to PRL.

Anyway, as we see a European (indeed, international) Internet (yes,
with a big 'I') form, issues such as policy-based routing will become
paramount.  I believe we are designing technical solutions with a
definite political lean so that we are forced to engineer our
networks as we would like to see them being built (yes, I am indeed
questioning our technical objectivity).  As much as we would like
to see a fully-connected internet, with DoD (or PTT, or the Ministry
of Education, or whomever) footing the bill, this isn't going to
happen ("You can't get there from here").  And our design should
reflect this.

	Now, instead of suggesting various kludges to the DNS I think we
	should go ahead and start building a European Internet - now!

Bien entendu!  The DNS does what it does satisfactorily, and if
changes need to be made anywhere, it is in our basic philisophical
premise that all IP addresses are created equal.  They aren't --
some are more equal than others.

The time is now for the sort of policy-based tools that have
been discussed in the last couple of weeks on this matter.  Perhaps
Bob would care to make (either personally or as Host-Req. honcho)
some suggestions about the philosophy of such tools?

I see a unique (and somewhat grotesque) mechanism that performs
a weighted sorting of IP addresses based on long-term and transient
reachability, administrative preference, type of service, and
(quite significant) the basis of the application requesting the
service.  Regarding the later, it might not be important if mail
is delayed because of a short (&lt;30min), but it could be very
important whose borders it crosses (for PTT laws), or who pays
for the carriage.

	There's no fancy new technology involved, so technically it can be
	done in *very* short time. While we're waiting for real standards,
	a number of people will have a useful service and we may get some
	experience from working with big, real, networks. Later, when the
	standards are stable we migrate into them, just as everybody else.

Standards exist: one can run IP over X.25 demand-switched circuits.
While this isn't the choice of preference, you can order it today.
International ISDN service is more attractive, but is not wide
spread (as I remember, Germany and Sweden are leaders in deployment).
I would like to see an 802.2-like encapsulation scheme for ISDN/
Q.931 (that is HDLC/LLC2 [or X.25 layer 2 -- it layer 3 that becomes
truly offensive]).

	Finally: I am aware of the work that is going on to create a real
	European Internet and I do hope that work will be a success. Still,
	I cannot understand why that is not considered part of any official
	European networking strategy - why Europe should wait instead of
	getting something non-standard (but operational) in the air today,
	use it while waiting for standards and finally migrate to standards.

Being new to European networking, I haven't heard anything except
the rumours that make it to the East Coast.  I would like to hear
more, and of course make whatever contribution I can...
