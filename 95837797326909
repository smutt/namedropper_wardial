	I'm trying to figure out how to set up a kosher domain (call
it foo.com.) that is properly registered, but that operates in isolation
from all other zones, including the Internet Root.  At some point in
future, when this isolated network joins the Internet, the isolated
foo.com. would join the Internet Root (pardon my terminology) without
having to change any usage or domain designation.  I have some theories
about how this could be done in BIND/named.  Bear with me.  :-)

	It would seem to me to be best to set things up such that
the foo.com. authoritative server would answer NXDOMAIN for any
questions about domains outside of foo.com., including root.  Is
this a good way to isolate?

	It would seem to me to make sense simply to eliminate the
root NS and A entries in the cache, making the foo.com. name server(s)
unable to know anything about any other domain, including bar.com.,
.edu., "", etc.  However, I can't tell whether this would cause an
error or the NXDOMAIN response that I seek.

	If simply eliminating NS and A entries for the root
servers in the cache file is insufficient to get a NXDOMAIN answer
from the foo.com. server(s), then what if I pointed root back
at the foo.com. server?  Would BIND now think itself to be
authoritative for everything and answer, with authority, "NXDOMAIN"?

	Pardon me if this has been asked a thousand times, but I
read this group rather regularly and I haven't seen it asked lately.
I would appreciate it if someone could dust off an answer and send
it off to me, and the newsgroup if you think it worthwhile mentioning
again.

	Thanks much.
