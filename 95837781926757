Sorry that one got away from me...

As I was saying, I've written a mailer which deals with all these
networks and hence must deal with this problem.  Let me note that the
problem is a little different from that which you describe.  Seems to me
that eventually, in theory, only one domain-server lookup should be
necessary since everything should be named within this space.  If this
is the case, you "only" have to deal with the set of MX and A records
returned by the domain query.  In practice this will probably not be the
case, but my understanding is that CSNet is moving in this direction,
and that UUCP will be (though perhaps I'm wrong on the latter).  Who
knows what BITNET and assorted DECnets will do.

Anyway, currently my mailer uses a rather simple approach: it
searches the databases in a hard-wired order and returns the
first successful match.  I justify this design as follows.  

What factors are relevant in this selection?  As I see it, they are the
speed of the network and the politics of using that network for the
message in question.  I use the ordering below.  To my knowledge this
ordering will be correct for most hosts for speed, and for politics.
However, I will admit that my thinking is biased towards hosts on the
Arpanet, and hence this scheme may be faulty for hosts not on the
Arpanet.  I'm assuming that the MX weighting factors will take care of
this problem.

	TCP/IP &gt; DECnet &gt; CSNet, BITNET, Cafard, UUCP
