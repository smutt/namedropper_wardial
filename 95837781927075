The violation is in having both a CNAME and an HINFO.  I had always
assumed that you would be required to manipulate the TTL's so that you
didn't have unexpired conflicting information, or at least not for
more than a few hours.  I think there is a concensus that one-year
TTL's are not acceptable.  I don't think people are using more than a
week.  My view (which others have also supported) is that if you are
using one week TTL's, you set them down to one day at least a week
before making any change that owuld introduce an inconsistency of this
kind.  Then to one hour a day before making the change etc.  Except that
at some point you decide that you're willing to live with being
inaccessible for a certain period of time and just don't bother.  In
that case, it doesn't much matter what an implementatio does about
"impossible" things, since the domain administrator has chosen to be
inconsistent for a certain period of time.  The only proviso I would
add is that you should make sure not to get into a loop when things
are invalid.  In that case, simply returning the information that
appears to be valid, or failing, is probably safer than going off and
making queries into a distributed database that is likely not to be
consistent.
