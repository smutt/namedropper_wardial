	As long as the OSI model is concerned, this is definitely a transport
	function -- or a routing function. Its need derives from the practice
	of allocating several IP addresses to an host, e.g. one per interface
	in BSD implementations; in principle, having several network interfaces
	is not considered a good reason for allocating several NSAP addresses
	in the ISO networks. Requesting the application to sort network
	addresses by using a magic metric is questionable at best...

I disagree with this.  Routing deals with how you get packets to a
certain address.  Choosing the address that best corresponds to
where you want to go is a "naming" function.  Perhaps this isn't
an artifact of TCP/IP, either.  If an ISO host has both CLNS and
CONS connections, won't it have two different addresses (even if
the variation is just in the LSAP)?

Anyway, assigning different addresses to different interfaces is
not a Berkeleyism.  It is required of IP.

In any case, the application should be required to have any
knowledge of this, I agree.  But requiring it to "call this function
in this library" before opening the connection should suffice (not
unlike using a resolver).

	The case of the mail routing is different, for the very purpose of the
	application is to apply relaying of messages. One could expect that
	intelligent mail routers will acquire somehow a knowledge of the "mail
	network" topology, and use that for choosing the best destination.
	After all, this is exactly what the UUCP mailer do!

I understood the point of MX records as a way of expressing this
topology, so that the mailers themselves would not need specialized
knowledge...  (I don't know about UUCP -- besides mangling headers,
it seems to me that mail from Boston to Montreal frequently goes
via some university in Texas.  By what metric this is considered
optimal is unknown to me.)

Anyway, I would prefer to have the knowledge of "optimality"
kept in a single place and well administered.  The DNS does this.
When one starts customizing each application on each site, one is
not only wasting time, one is inviting misconfigurations.

	The real problem is thus "how to express the network topology". The
	current solution (MX records) is probably not sophisticated enough; we
	need to give more data than just a relay and a cost, e.g. the fact that
	such destination belongs to such autonomous network. In order to get
	convinced, just try to devise a routing strategy which will send a
	single copy of a message from the US to say France, if the message has
	several recipients in France, on different hosts, all reachable with MX
	and A records in the DNS.

You haven't specified if the host given by the most preferred MX
records (for all recepients) is the same host.  In such a case,
this might make sense.  But if one of the MXs is "inria.inria.fr"
and another is "mcsun.nl" (or whatever), then one should NOT
override this decision.

Obviously, we have much to disagree about.  At the suggestion of
other readers, we might take this discussion of the air...  on
the other hand, they might well be enjoying this.

I'm waiting for Paul to recover from Hawaii and jump in...
