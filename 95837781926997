No, not all hosts support zone transfers.  The TOPS-20 implementations,
for example, do not offer virtual circuits and zone transfers don't fit
in a UDP datagram.

If *-name matching worked in all implementations (the NIC generates
NAME-ERROR) you could get the functionality you desire.  Note that you
don't really want the entire zone to walk the tree; you just want the NS
records.  Therefore, if you queried the root for
	* NameServer INternet
you would get the NS records pointing to COM, EDU, GOV, ORG, etc.  You
could then ask one of the COM servers
	*.COM NameServer INternet
to go down one more level.

This ask-for-the-information-I-want would reduce the cost of this
operation from fearsome to nearly nothing.  I share Jeff Schiller's
concern that massive operations are antisocial and people should have
negative incentive to doing them on a regular basis.  I disagree,
however, that that is reason enough to disallow it.

I think the current situation is partly an artifact of how
the implementation of delegation was chosen.  If instead of having
name-server records there were sub-zone records, we could get the
desired effect.  Specifically, today we have
	COM	NS	server_for_COM
	COM	NS	another
	EDU	NS	server_for_EDU
	...etc...
Instead, if we had
	""	SZ	COM server_for_COM
	""	SZ	COM another
	""	SZ	EDU server_for_EDU
	...etc...
we could just ask the root for the SZ records and go from there.  I
don't such a reorganization of the database makes any of the algorithms
any easier or harder than dealing with NS records, just different.
