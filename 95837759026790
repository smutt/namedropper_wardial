    Hi:
 
    With one exception (a host supporting the Diamond/X.400 package) I do not have
    WKS records in my domain data base. Is someone verifying in any mailer
    whether there is a TCP/SMTP available prior to exporting mail? I have the
    impression that nobody cares anyway, so I left the WKS records out. I'd be
    happy to change that in my data base if there are implementations around 
    which "do it right".

The Symbolics implementation tries to do it right, but because so many
of the Internet site managers simply don't include the correct
information, we are forced to kludge various services onto the hosts'
lists.  An even bigger joke is that most domain servers, if you ask for
the WKS records, do NOT support domain service!

Our system has depended on a distributed (and accurate) network database
of objects since Release 5 (April 83, I think).  The first joke we
encountered was somebody advertising (in mail) the internet time service
(WVVB?), but his HOSTS.TXT entry didn't say he supported that service.

Please, folks, if you are going to implement a network database, make it
correct and complete.  Some systems do care about that information, A
LOT, and hopefully more and more systems will to.

For those who want to continue reading, here's some motivation.  Our
systems (LispMs) are moderately generic beasts when it comes to
protocols and concepts.  I'll use two examples to illustrate why we care
about a network database.  Suppose you want to login to some other host.
You can't tell just be the type of host or what networks it is on what
protocol to talk.  There are many possibilities.  There is SUPDUP of
CHAOS, TELNET over CHAOS, SUPDUP over TCP, TELNET over TCP, CHAT over
PUP, CTERM over DECNET, and a few home-brew ones.  What's worse is that
some hosts support some subset of the above.  Some protocols are more
desirable than others (SUPDUP is more desirable than TELNET).  Similarly
some networks are more desirable than others (TCP is more desirable than
CHAOS (end-to-end software checksum and larger packets)).  Only when you
have complete knowledge of what protocols the other end speaks, and over
what mediums you can get there, and what protocols the local machine
knows how to speak can you make an educated guess as the "best" way to
get from here to there.  The other example is file transfer.  Among the
possibilities are QFILE over CHAOS, TCP/FTP over TCP, TFTP over UDP,
NFILE (our own) over CHAOS, NFILE over TCP, NFS over TCP, ??? over
DECNET, EFTP over PUP, ??? over XNS, etc.  Again, some hosts (in theory
all hosts) can implement more than one, and only with complete
information can a program make an educated guess.  Users should not have
the burden of knowing how to get from here to there.  That's what
computers and accurate network databases are for!!!
