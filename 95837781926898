About a month ago, I asked the question "What is a host's name" in reference
to a mail acceptance problem between mail hosts that I support and another
mail host system, asking if the .ARPA is part of a hosts name.  I promised to
summarize the responses.  Many thanks to those who responded.

Here is the summary:

&gt;From Capt. StJohns of the DDN PMO &lt;STJOHNS@SRI-NIC.ARPA&gt;:

Sheesh!  OK, the official name INCLUDES the .ARPA until such time
they join an Official domain (.MIL, .dca.MIL,  .EDU,  etc).   The
policy  for  this  is  contaonted  in  one  of the DDN management
bulletins issued about 3 or 4 months ago.

-------------------------------------
From: postel@bel.isi.edu (Jon Postel)

I think if you look at RFCs 920 and 921 on the domain system you should
get the idea that all host in the Internet (including MILNET hosts) must
use domain style names, and the sooner the better.  The DDN management has
been slow to back up these RFCs as MILNET requirements, thought there have
significant steps, and the note from St.Johns should be clear enough.
Technically, the system can't work unless all the hosts have domain style
names and are all registered in the name servers.  There are now many hosts
in the Internet that do not have any version of HOSTS.TXT and use only the
name servers (and a small cache) to verify host names and translate them to
addresses.

-----------------------------
From: HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA
Sender: STAHL@SRI-NIC.ARPA

I just wanted to reinforce what Jon has stated and mention that the
management bulletin referred to by Mike St Johns is DDN Management
Bulletin No. 32.  It directed the removal of all old-style names from
the host tables.

-----------------------------------------
From: Bill Barns  &lt;WWB.TYM@OFFICE-1.ARPA&gt;

The documents to which (I assume) Mike StJohns alludes are DDN Management 
Bulletins 22 and 32.

Even these documents are less than unambiguous to a very legalistic mind, but 
#22 contains the statement "Briefly, all existing official names will become 
nicknames, and the new official name will be formed by adding the domain name 
".ARPA" to the old official name" and #32 says "Network mailers are required to
use primary host names..." and "Users sending electronic mail should use 
primary host names in all mail destinations and sources."  Although there are a
couple of semantic pinholes here, they are really tiny and it is difficult to 
imagine anyone reading these documents and seriously believing that those 
pinholes represent any real meaning.

----------------------------
Pat Barron &lt;pdb@SEI.CMU.EDU&gt;

At the bottom of page 29 of RFC 822, it says:

"When a message crosses a domain boundary, all addresses must be specified
in the full format, ending with the top-level domain name in the right-
most field.  It is the responsibility of mail forwarding services to ensure
that addresses conform with this requirement."

----------------------------------------
From: braden@braden.isi.edu (Bob Braden)

A host name can be (and often is) abbreviated locally to the first component of
the full domain name, but the proper and ocmplete name of your host is the
fully-qualified domain name, and it is this full name that must appear in ALL
mail headers and SMTP messages that leave your host.

I have noticed a resistance on the part of host software developers to
incorporate this simple truth into their world. They seem to resist the
idea of a local name for user convenience, as distinct from the "real
name".  Perhaps that is what is confusing your errant host administrator.

-------------------------------------------
From: Paul Mockapetris &lt;pvm@venera.isi.edu&gt;

The .ARPA is part of the host name.  Nothing else makes sense.

------------------------------------------
From: John Lekashman &lt;lekash@orville.arpa&gt;

Isn't it nice that you are both right, sort of.  The hosts
name is, or can be, anything one wants.  Of course, the
address, which includes the .arpa in this case, is what 
he should be stamping on an message when sending.  Comparing
apples and oranges always results in some confusion.

---------------------------------------------
From: Robert Elz &lt;munnari!kre@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;

You're right, .arpa is part of your host name, and should
be there in the incoming Rcpt To SMTP line.

--------------------------------------------------------------
From:  Bruce Orchard &lt;ORCHARD/BRUC@scarecrow.waisman.wisc.edu&gt;

You'll probably have to do what I did:  Make a list
of host names that other hosts think of as your host
name and accept any of them in mail.  My list
has 7 entries on it now.  The strangest one
is scarecrow.waisman.wisc.edu.arpa, which is what
a few BITNET sites think of as our name.

---------------------------------------------
From: cfe+@andrew.cmu.edu (Craig F. Everhart)

... the ``.arpa'' IS part of the host's name.  As is the ``.edu'' in
``andrew.cmu.edu''.  The other viewpoint might have made some sense in 1982,
but not since then.

Unfortunately, the other viewpoint is one that is encouraged by some
1982-vintage berkeley sendmail configuration files.

----------------------------------------------------

From: morgan@lrc-eds.ARPA (Capt Rusty Morgan (NSAL))

Your  question  to  'namedroppers'  et  al.  has  elicited   many
responses,  some  of  them even hit the point!  I will inform our
contractor   that   our    "1982-vintage"    Berkeley    Sendmail
configuration file will have to pass the .DOMAIN name thru to the
remote SMTP server.
