&gt; [...] It would be convenient to have people on
&gt; the outside simply send to person@phri.nyu.edu and have phri.nyu.edu be a
&gt; nickname for phri.phri.nyu.edu, but I can't seem to figure out any way to
&gt; do that.

at UC Davis, we also had the same desires.  i wanted the
name "ucdavis.edu" to be a "super-host" that would handle
many duties of the domain, but the machine that actually
does this is called "ucdavis.ucdavis.edu".  we tried using
CNAMEs and had difficulties similar to yours.  we tried
MXs briefly but had troubles with them as well.  MXs also
apply only to mail.  our eventual solution (which i wasn't
clever enough to think up) was to have A records for both
names.  if you ask about "ucdavis.edu" you can get the
domain info and an A record.  if you ask about the name
"ucdavis.ucdavis.edu" you'll get an A record with the same
address.  our domain "ucdavis.edu" is effectively a host.

we've had no problems with this system that i know of.
