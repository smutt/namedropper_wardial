In article &lt;605@trwind.UUCP&gt; simpson@trwind.trw.com (Scott Simpson) writes:
&gt;In RFC 1065 on SMI, it describes an OBJECT IDENTIFIER tree that looks
&gt;something like
&gt;    |		  |				  |	       |
&gt; directory(1)   mgmt(2)			    experimental(3)  private(4)
&gt;		  |					       |
&gt;		 MIB(1)					     enterprises(1)
&gt;			       
&gt;This tree is a means to some end.  What is that end?  I understand that
&gt;ASN.1 is a syntax notation for doing things like type model conversion

ASN.1 is actually intended to allow protocol writers to express their
procotols withouthaving to worry too much about how the bytes are
represented either on the network or within various different kinds 
of machines.  ASN.1 has a secondary purpose of keeping me in the pink,
as I've writtne plenty of encoders/decoders/pseudo-compilers for 
it's syntax. :-).

&gt;and how so?  The SMI document lists paths down this tree (e.g.,
&gt;1.3.6.1.2.1).  Why are these paths generated and how are they used?

OBJECT IDENTIFIERS are just what they say.  A defined way to name
something.  THe planet earth has agreed to form the above sited
tree such that someone can always find there way.  Because OSI
standards are planetary in nature, it's difficult to get everyone
to agree to the same scheme.  Therefore, the tree at it's highest
level was 'branched' by the three primary ( yes, I can count )
standards serving organizations (ANSI in the US rolls up under 
OSI, State department work in the US rolls up under CCITT).

Each org then partitioned it's branches by some scheme that made
local sense, all the way to the bottom.

In short, there isn't a lot of rhyme or reason, and there is 
no way yo ucan parse the tree without knowing all the political
ins and outs of each issuing organization, but if the world
continues to live by aligning it's self along political boundaries,
you will never get a transfer syntax (BER is 2,1,1) confused with
a SMI MIB type of item.
