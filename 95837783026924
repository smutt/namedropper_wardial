Bob,
	Thanks to you and the Host Requirements WG for addressing the
TCP domain issue quickly and thoroughly.  I should also explicitly
commend Craig for being right as usual...good thing we have people
like that around.

Some specific comments on your text:

&gt;            A DNS resolver SHOULD send a (non-zone-transfer) query first  |
&gt;            using UDP, and then try again using TCP if the UDP attempt    |
&gt;            fails.
&gt;                                                                          |
&gt;&lt;&lt;maybe this should explicitly say "...if the UDP attempt results in
&gt;a REFUSED bit in the reply"?&gt;&gt;
I think you meant the TRUNCATED bit rather than the REFUSED bit.  I would
rather that the SHOULD be a MUST, with the escape clause that resolvers and
servers may have private agreements to violate this.

       
&gt;                 MX record retrievals are likely to overflow a single     |
&gt;                 UDP datagram, and ...
Is this really true?  Still, Craig's point is correct.


&gt;Based upon a glance at Berkeley Bind, I would say that a server supporting
&gt;TCP is no big deal, and in fact there is considerably less machinery for
&gt;TCP than for UDP (but that has to do with multihoming issue, I think).
You're right that under Berkeley UNIX TCP isn't harder (though I seem to
recall that the code in Bind to handle incomplete TCP transactions was
rewritten several times after it didn't work in all cases).

Also, I'd like to see text on some related topics:

One of the comments I got back on my previous message said that I was wrong
about the IBM VM implementation: the resolver could be configured to use
UDP, but the server insisted on contacting other servers using TCP.  Although
this sounds improbable to me, there should be no harm in saying that the
same rules that apply to resolvers also apply to servers when the servers
forward or internally generate queries.

Perhaps the fact that TCP must be used for zone transfers is worth a
mention.

Many of the current bogus uses of TCP in the domain system are a result
of an unfortunate decision on the part of the Bind implementors on how
to map the old host table routines onto the domain system ("don't close
host table file after each query" became "use TCP for queries").  Perhaps
a comment on this decision in particular or some more general comments
on how to provide a host-table-like interface to the domain system are
in order?

The proper use of the REFUSED bit should be clarified.  I suggest two
cases as possible ones where refusal is acceptable:
 - a server may refuse to do a zone transfer.
 - a server may refuse any TCP request that would result in a short
   answer (one that would not be truncated if it were a UDP query).
Are there others?

						Philip
