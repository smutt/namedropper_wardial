&gt;From article &lt;9005072049.AA02275@skinfaxe.diku.dk&gt;, by thorinn@DIKU.DK (Lars Henrik Mathiesen):
&gt; In an email correspondence with Piet Beertema (piet@cwi.nl) the
&gt; following explanation emerged (potentially sensitive parts elided):
&gt; 
&gt;                             ... . But there are indeed internal
&gt;    political problems in Germany that appear to prevent a proper
&gt;    DNS setup for DE; and Germany really isn't the only where there
&gt;    are such problems: the UK is yet another example. Main point
&gt;    is that some people still ... don't ... trust others.
&gt;    The original DSN setup came from DFN, which serves only academia;
&gt;    the "additional server" on unido is meant to serve *all* of DE
&gt;    (mainly implying that also non-Internet-connected networks served
&gt;    by EUnet will be included). And if you look at where the nameservers
&gt;    for DE are, you'll notice they're *only* in the USA; there's not
&gt;    one single secondary server in Europe!

&gt; As I read that, DFN (Deutsche Forschungs-Net?) says "We own the DE.
&gt; domain, nobody else belongs." And the NIC says "German sites must be
&gt; in the DE. domain, please register with DFN." And we get the current
&gt; mess.

Well, i don't think this is a correct representation of the situation.
Besides minor errors (... DFN does not only serve academia, ... yes we have
internal political problems but the DNS in the respect described here is
not part of those problems)

The main facts are these:

1 The current setup is intentionally to allow full use of the DNS for
  all those sites in germany who cannot currently reach the US-
  or even european Internet, but who want to use the DNS nevertheless,
  and not only for domainname to address resolution, but also vice versa.

2 Domains which have network reachability only within germany are DNS
  registered with the DE. zone on unido (unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de),
  and have their according IN-ADDR.ARPA. zone set up in a similar way by
  faked entries in the unido... DNS server. These domains have usually only
  MX records to their preferred forwarder for E-mail in the official DE zone
  on uunet.uu.net.

3 Domains under DE having aquired full US and European Internet connectivity
  are also entered into the official DE zone on uunet.uu.net (and of
  course on the DE zone on unido...).

4 All german DNS installations are obliged to use unido... as a forwarder,
  so that those domains under (2) are correctly resolved, and not only those
  from the DE zone, but the IN-ADDR.ARPA. zones too.

5 The administrative responsibility for the DE domain is handed to
  the University of Dortmund, which runs unido..., this applies for
  the official DE zone from uunet too. The DFN has no cards in the DNS,
  but owns the DBP.DE zone.

6 Not having aquired internet access in germany is not a political but
  a financial problem. Within germany all academic and most other
  interested paries have the chance to run IP over X.25 in a cost efficient
  matter through the WiN. Aquiring international IP connectivity will
  require to share the costs for these international links too, and this
  cost is sometimes prohibitive. not because it's too expensive, but
  because IP is still considered exotical by those who spend the universities
  money (Mostly higher ranks from computing centers who never used
  a network like the internet).

Conclusion: The german DE zone setup is intentionally, useful and proved
to be functional. As the changes in german networking are amongst the
most fluctuating in the world with respect to IP  currently, the state
of the DNS may not reflect the actual reachability of networks to the
point, but then - our university has waited 4 month for NIC/NSF/MERIT to
enter our data correctly into the US databases.


&gt;    In all cases it has been offered that mcsun.eu.net run primary (for
&gt;    those countries that don't have their own server yet) or secondary
&gt;    (for those that do). Neither the Brits nor the Germans have accepted
&gt;    that (yet). ...

There are no advantages in using alternate DE servers to uunet with
the current scheme. The problem that must be solved in this respect is
to allow non US connected networks into the DNS (especially the
IN-ADDR.ARPA zones). If that is done, we may well drop the current
scheme and have one common DE zone.

&gt;    The Brits have the problem that their nameservers are unreachable
&gt;    *very* often (it's the case again right now!), which clearly calls
&gt;    for the need of a secondary server (in Europe). But sofar they
&gt;    have refused to have mcsun.eu.net run secondary for UK, because
&gt;    they "have no control over it". Well, my answer to that is that
&gt;    they don't have control over their secondary aos.brl.mil either!

Actually i don't know about the british situation, but it seems that they
have more political pressure against IP than anyone else, so that may
be part of the reasons for arguing this way.
