Frankly, we need to find some way to have our cake and eat it too.

Is there any merit to the idea that "upscale" domain hosts should use
mail relays to reach the "non-upscale" hosts that cannot hack domains?

Use of mail relays should enable an upscale nucleus group to get
started without forcing them to forfeit relatively normal mail
connectivity with the rest of the net.

This problem is linked to the current problem that results from some
hosts being "hidden" because they are not yet (for some reason)
included in the published SRI-NIC HOST TABLES.  The problem that has
just surfaced is that operational use of the new domain names produces
the same "hidden host" phenomena on a much greater scale.

I strongly recommend the use of mail relays as a formally adopted
policy for the interim period between now and cut-over day on July
15th, when ever that day may come.

I further strongly recommend Internet adoption of a firm long-term
policy on use of mail relays by any "hidden host" regardless of its
reasons for being hidden, if that host runs into trouble getting
through to any other host that has trouble recognizing it because it
is "hidden".

In every instance of the use of the string "hidden host", I mean it to
include any host that is not recognizable by looking for its name in
some legitimately useable published SRI-NIC host table, regardless of
the reason for the name not being in the table.  We are about to have
at least two host table choices which are guaranteed to be subsets of
the set of all Internet hosts, and this yields many new hidden hosts.

To make this work, some "unhidden hosts" must agree to serve as relays
and install host tables that can recognize the hidden hosts that they
agree to serve.  This arrangement is widely known and used today.  It
has been implemented in the UCB UUCP gateway, the CSNET GATEWAY, the
BITNET GATEWAY, and the MAILNET GATEWAY.  It is used more unofficially
by many local mail subnets, such as UCI for the Information and
Computer Science Department hosts behind the UCI-ICSA relay, and by
SU-SCORE for a variety of hosts at Stanford.  CMU and MIT and UDEL and
many others also do this for their own private lists of hidden local
hosts.

As I see the domain conversion situation evolving, from now till May
15, 1985, any upscale host using a new domain name on a test run is by
definition hidden, and should not complain about others not being
upscale enough to be reachable.  They should make private relay
arrangements, until some public service relays can take up the task.

By May 15 1985, public service relays should be established and
announced to provide public mail gateway services between the upscale
hosts and their slower moving brethren.  During this period, until
July 15, 1985, both upscale domain hosts and their slower moving
brethren will by definition be hidden from each other.  Every host in
the internet will be a "hidden host" for the interim.

After July 15, 1985 the original roles will reverse.  Upscale hosts
will be the norm, while their slower moving brethren will by
definition remain hidden hosts, which will be responsible for making
their own private relay arrangements, just as we now suggest that our
upscale friends make private relay arrangements during test runs.

Adoption of this scheme, plus adoption of a continuing long term
policy for all hidden hosts to either 1) arrange privately for relay
service, or 2) not complain about not being recognized, should
forever more resolve this terrible dilemma.

My basic underlying logic in all this is very simple: If you are
hiding from me, I can't see you.  If you want me to see you, then you
should help me to do so.  If you don't help me, I must not be expected
to expend much energy on seeking out your identity.  In other words,
if you are hiding, then you should not complain if I don't see you.

(This is not a technical issue.  It is a social morality issue.  The
fact that we are all about to pass through the transform from unhidden
to hidden, and back again, should give us cause to adopt a socially
acceptable solution for ourselves.  Lets hear it for self interest!)

Of course, this logic only makes sense if reasonable means are
available to help the afflicted to unhide.  Relays provide an already
installed means for dealing with this dilemma.  My purpose in making
this proposal is to transit to domains.  I believe that relays will
provide the means for every hostmaster and postmaster in the entire
Internet community to know at every step, how to reach any other host
in the entire internet community, without need for any significant
central administrative effort, or hassle for anyone.

Good luck everyone!  We are all about to hit the white water!  -- Stef
