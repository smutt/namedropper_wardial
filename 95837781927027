Before we get mired down in the bits, let's give an explicit statement
of the design goals for mail naming.  I'm not familiar with an exhaustive
list of the goals people are trying to address, so it's sometimes hard
to tell what goal someone is trying to address in a given message.  I
wonder if we can agree on the goals, much less the design!

Here are the goals I can think of:

1) Ability to address a person at an organization without having to know
what machine they actually have an account on.  So if I know David
Plummer works at Symbolics I should be able to address mail to him at
Symbolics.COM without having to remember how to spell the name of his
LispM.

2) Ability to minimize network and cpu resources required to deliver a
msg by remotely determining the binding of a valid mail name (e.g.
Plummer@Symbolics.COM) with the ultimate intended destination of a msg
sent to that mail name (Plummer's LispM).  The alternative is to simply
send the mail through Symbolics.COM and have it forward the mail to
Plummer's LispM.

3) Ability to specify multiple mail gateways between the Internet and
other networks, e.g. to specify that mail to any subdomain of Apple.COM
should be forwarded through FOO.COM.  As Bill Nowicki points out such
gateways could actually bridge parts of the Internet which have been
rendered non-connected at the IP (or EGP or whatever) level.  My
impression is that this issue is a lot more complicated than people have
thought because it's not at all clear how the gateway machine knows that
it's the gateway.  Does it only use information which is globally
available in the domain system, or does it have to be hardwired with
special information?  The latter seems very tricky, the former
potentially ugly unless it's done right.  I don't believe that MX
records handle this case correctly, although I confess I haven't read
that RFC very carefully.

4) Ability for a user to send mail from a host that won't receive mail,
yet to receive replies and error messages correctly.  It's not clear
to me that the domain system should handle this rather than a combination 
of RFCs 822 and 821 (munging the mail header and return path).

5) Mail loops are to be avoided.

6) Economic factors in delivery of a message should be expressable
within the system (e.g., local phone calls vs long distance).

7) We should be able to validate a mail name in real time.  And more
generally, the Internet doesn't have the performance for complex
solutions.  We shouldn't have to query a dozen name servers and run wild
goose chases around the entire continent to deliver every lousy piece of
mail.

More suggestions?
