As the recent discussion of MD and MF types has illustrated, the domain
system has created a need to refine the semantics of information
available from the domain system.  Mail isn't the only issue; for
example, the address RRs now make multiple host addresses available to
many applications which didn't have them before, and we start wondering
if order is important, how we select an address to use, etc.

As a general principle, I believe that we should start thinking about
the domain system as a general mechanism for distributing data and work
on defining modular specs or guidelines for applications.  Mail is a
good example.

In any case, a couple of additional thoughts on MF and MD:

The original idea was that MD was the destination and MF was something
willing to eventually get it to the destination.

Some group of organizations connected via a bad (intermittent, low
bandwidth, or some such) link to the rest of the world might use MD/MF
combinations to try to get mail over the bad link even when the
destination was down.

Similarly, an organization might choose to make a number of alternates
available via MF partners to remove queueing requirements from senders
on small hosts.

A personal computer might access mail by calling up a big brother
mail drop via POP or some other system to download mail.  In this case,
the PC host might be represented as MFs exclusively.

A sending host might prefer, given a destination that returns both MF
and MDs, to believe that it would be faster/more reliable/more secure to
wait for a MD to be available than to use the MFs.

Perhaps we should deconceive MD and MF, and create a new RR called say,
MX.  The data section for MX would carry multiple data items: a domain
name for a mail agent (i.e. the contents of present MD and MFs), AND a
integer "distance" value.  The distance value would be zero if the agent
was the destination, and a number representing "closeness" to the
destination otherwise.  The idea here is that smaller distance values
should be selected in preference to larger ones, all other things being
equal.  (It might be possible to figure out some good unit for
"distance" but I'm not going to try and defend one.)

The advantages of this scheme are:

	Caching would be easier because we use a single data type.

	Mail senders don't have to worry about two types.

	Selecting between different MFs might be more rational.

However, I'm not sure we want to replace our existing system with MX,
even though its clearly better than the MD &amp; MF RRs we have now.
I do suggest that we use these experiences when we design new RR types.
