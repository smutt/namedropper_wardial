Hi.

Well, i must have had temporary (i hope) brain damage the other day
when i questioned the need for the IN-ADDR info.  Sure it is
important.  The comments indicate it is used quite a bit, and also
that the NIC is prepared to delegate authority for subdomains of the
IN-ADDR tree.

The comments also show that the Berkeley code was ok about having a
file of data since that was only for the authoritative servers.

Somehow we got into the subject of using IP addresses for
authentication.  This is really off the subject for the namedroppers
list.

If there is a Ethernets (call it X) connected to the ARPANET via a
gateway (G1), and there is another Ethernet (Y) connected to the
ARPANET via another gateway (G2), and there are workstations and
computers on both Ethernets.  Lets say that workstation A and B are on
X, and computer C is on Y.  Now lets say that A is an authorized user
of C, and that B is not.

At the IP level (with a little help from X) B can pretend to be A.  B
can send datagrams to C with A's address in the IP source field.  The
gateways will forward these datagrams and they will get to C.  C will
send response addressed to A.  When G1 forwards the response to A on X
it is (at the medium level) a broadcast and B can see it by operating
his Ethernet interface in promiscious mode.  B can now formulate his
next datagram to C.

If A is paying attention, it will see datagrams from C in response to
something it doesn't know about.  This will probably lead to A trying
to "reset" the conversation.  This might prevent B from getting
anything useful out of its hacking.  But, if A is not paying attention
B can have a field day.

Of course, any interesting information or resource is protected by
higher level mechanisms than a simple check of the source IP address.
On the other hand, if an address check shows that something fishy is
going on it is good to note it.

I'd suggest that people really interested in authentication and
privacy mechanisms join the Privacy-Interest mailing list.  The
secretary for the list is John Linn (LINN@BBNCCY.ARPA).
