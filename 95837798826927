I think the general idea of the proposed draft RFC is excellent.
I would like to quibble at some details.

1) The RT records are to be used by the network layer. Like
all network activity this should work without reference to
domain names. It seems more correct to make this an
extension of the in-addr.arpa domain

 17.128.in-addr.arpa.	IN	RT	10  sh.prime.com.

is a route to a whole class B network (128.17). Alternatively

 17.18.19.20.in-addr.arpa. IN	RT	30  relay.prime.com.

is a route to a specific host. The names on the right here are 
used to choose X25 or ISDN or other routes -- their IN A records
are irrelevant in this context.

2) The X25 and ISDN types should be network types parallel to
IN not parts of the IN network info. E.g.

  Relay.prime.com.	X25	A	311061700956
			ISDN	A	150887929603217 003

Records of the form

  31106700956.x25-addr.arpa.	IN	X25	x.y.edu

should mean that host x.y.edu will accept X25-over-IP calls
for X.25 address 31106700956 using some to-be-defined protocol
for running X.25 over IP. I would point out that CISCO have
such a protocol and might release it (my guess: they would
release it if there was a threat of some other protocol
becoming a standard).

Similarly for IN ISDN. Yes ISDN over IP could be used to provide
telephone/fax/whatever connectivity to workstations with IP
connectivity. It may not be as clearly desirable as IP over ISDN
but it is possible and whatever the theoretical difficulties I
suspect it would work fine in practice in many situations.

3) It is possible to imagine access to X25 and ISDN A records from
boxes which don't run IP. So it would be nice to define a protocol
for accessing the DNS over raw X.25 and raw ISDN networks. Since
the DNS can be accessed by UDP and TCP this shouldn't be hard.
