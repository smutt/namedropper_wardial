Suppose I get a nice clean name-not-found response. What TTL do I use
when I insert a dummy entry into my cache? There aren't any RR records
comming back so there isn't any slot for the server to pass me that
info.

Similarly, does the concept of authoritative apply to the data used for
locating servers? When I made the server cache, I copied the code from
the name/address cache, and it had an authoritative slot. Is the
server-info from some servers more reliable that others? When poking
around by hand, I see various views of the world that don't agree, but I
don't think that would ever happen in practice since my code is likely
to work it's way down from the top rather than ask a random server.

It looks to me like the nicname problem in message headers can be solved
well enough by simply using the primary name that comes back if you get
a CNAME response. Am I missing something interesting? (It won't work
right if somebody types in [1.2.3.4].) 

How up-to-date is the data on NIC and/or ISIF? Is it reasonable to use
them operationally yet?
	The server at NIC doesn't know about THINK or BNL44, but they are in
Hosts.txt.
	ISIF claims to know about "", but it doesn't know about EDU or COM.

How do I tell that Berkeley.EDU isn't a host? If I ask NIC about
Berkeley.EDU, it says go ask UCB-VAX or UCB-ARPA.  If I ask UCB-VAX, it
says, yup, I'm a server for Berkeley.EDU, and so is UCB-ARPA, but it
doesn't say Berkeley.EDU isn't a host. Is there a likely bug in my code,
or do I have to read between the lines and deduce that asking a server
that should know about a host that's also a domain means the host
doesn't exist?

Humm. I just asked NIC and ISIF about ARPA. They said, OK. But that's
all they said. When I asked them about EDU, they both said NIC and ISIF
are the servers (and told me their addresses). What's different about
these 2 cases?

Somebody recently mentioned that the packets were getting big. Does our
simple Resolver really HAVE to implement the TCP mode? I haven't seen
anything big enough to be be scarey. So far I managed to get one with
323 bytes by asking Symbolics about QUABBIN.SCRC.SYMBOLICS.COM (with
class=*). I haven't seen anything interesting to notice when doing a
name to address translation. If I get a truncated response, will it be
truncated on an RR boundry, or might there be a fragment to contend
with?
