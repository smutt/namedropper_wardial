	What about merging all the current top level domains into a nationwide
	domain ".US"? As Rudy Nedved pointed out, it is pretty self-centered
	of the US to assume that other countries will want to participate in
	its naming scheme.

Exactly.  From the surveys I've taken of the international electronic mail
community, I have yet to run into ANYONE outside the United States who is
interested in the EDU/COM/GOV domains.  Without exception, they all want
the top level domains to be based on geography and international boundaries.
All the people interested in EDU/COM/GOV, and all those who feel that
geography is inappropriate for domains, are within the USA.  Regions that
I've talked to include Europe, Israel, Korea, Japan, Australia, and Canada.
I've heard nothing from South America, Central America, Africa, or Central
Asia, presumably because these are less developed regions.

There is a lot of interest in X.400 in the international community.  There
seems to be a strong sentiment that future electronic mail will be exchanged
using the X.400 standard, and that all domains should be formed along the
X.400 lines.  (This interest is not universal, there are many people who
would prefer to continue to use ARPA or UUCP or BITNET or DECNET or Greybook
or whatever their local system is.)  They have the telcos behind them, with
the weight of law, saying that all data communication had better use the
telco facilities and standards, which are essentially X.25 and OSI.  These
requirements are especially strict for international traffic.

As I understand X.400, it's moving in the general direction of having the
top level domain be the country and the second level domain be the name
of the organization.  (It's not quite that simple, but that's the idea.
In the short term, the second level is the "administration management
domain" (the common carrier or X.25 network they buy service from.)
This is very similar to the ARPANET, except for the presence of some
top level domains like EDU which are not countries.

I'm told that the other countries (especially the UK) consider the
EDU, COM, and like domains to have a .US on top of them.  I think it
would be a very good idea for us to do the same.

Doing something about the second level is harder, since the US is so
big and there are many organizations.  The X.400 solution to this is to
include "extra information" to resolve ambiguities.  This information
can be a "locality" (e.g. city, state, region), a Zip code, a Telephone
number, or a Telex address.  I think it may be fair to make up other
types of attributes for this, e.g. a "type of org" attribute which
might be EDU, COM, or GOV.  How to handle this isn't all that
clear-cut.  But for the time being the problem isn't all that bad.
Even on UUCP (which is huge) a name count shows only about 400 orgs in
the COM domain, and 125 in EDU.
