	Mostly we need to educate people that knowing a machine's
	name does not change the security of that system.  Having
	an unlisted phone number does not prevent crank phone calls.

WIN makes a good point, but if you have your HINFO fields up-to-date
and one says "vax-11/750 old-broken-4.2BSD" it's close to telling
the world that "my house, which you can't miss because I just
painted it bright green, has a door lock that does not work and I
am at the office during the day" ... crank phone calls are often
random, but industrial espionage is directed, and giving someone
an easy tool to figure out your weaknesses is kind of suicidal.

Bill is right -- you can't stop the ability to *randomly* hit
machines, as you can't stop random crank phone calls, but unlisting
your phone number will stop directed crank phone calls, at least
temporarily.  Harpers Magazine notes this month that a full 1/2 of
all telephone numbers in Los Angeles are presently unlisted.

I know of at least one other "silicon valley company" that is
waiting until they close a bunch of holes before converting to a
domain server.

I think that's at least on the right track -- it also may be why
we're seeing a large lag time for all of .ARPA going away ... :-(
Security on the network has become a big problem overnight, far
faster than those working on the problems of "securing" a system
have been able to deal with it ...
