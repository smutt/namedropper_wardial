Whois provides the functionality required by the forgetfull person.
Unfortunately, whois may no longer be complete.  Lots of hosts are
known only to the domain name system.  

Finding peoples names will eventually be impossible as well.  As it is
now many people are not entered into the whois database.  What happens
in the future when there are too many people, and too many hosts to 
be put in the data base of an aging DEC behemoth (or even a modern
data base server machine)?

Maybe we should start thinking about expanding domain name (or something)
to replace whois.  Something that can provide for a distributed
database.  A way to querry the local server, and if not satisfied with the
reply(s) received, requerry in such a manner that a request is placed to 
the server above with wider scope, etc.  Thus many name lookups which
are local (such as on a campus or large company) would never go above
the local server, but there would be a way to querry for all names
with some string in them, etc, net wide, by trying servers higher
and higher up the ladder.

I'm sure there are problems with this idea.  There always are.  But there
are also problems with the status quo.  It seems that something will have
to be done.  The domain name system seems like it might be a good 
starting point.
