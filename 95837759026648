I would like to question this policy of limiting nicknames for several
reasons.

First let me make clear what I mean by nickname.  Imagine that the
Berkeley people decided to rename UCBVAX.BERKELEY.ARPA to be
GATEWAY-TO-EVERYWHERE.BERKELEY.ARPA (in some sense more meaningful
than the former and hence a better name).  We might then define 
UCBVAX.BERKELEY.ARPA as a nickname for the latter.  However, the
unqualified BERKELEY would not be a valid nickname as we clearly
don't want top-level domains to proliferate like this.

Now, why should we have nicknames?  One obvious reason given is that
hosts sometimes change names so we want to make the old names remain
valid for a while.  Two other reasons are that some good names are
long and hence annoying to type (see example above), and that it's
sometimes hard to remember the exact form of a name, so you provide
nicknames to make near-misses match (e.g., UCB-VAX vs UCBVAX).

Now, why shouldn't we have nicknames?  I've just re-read Ken
Harrenstien's original message of many months ago, and he only appears
to offer two reasons.  

First is to limit the size of HOSTS.TXT.  Well, as I recall, HOSTS.TXT
is being phased out soon anyway.  So why not simply limit the number of
nicknames recorded in HOSTS.TXT instead of trying to establish a policy
for domain server databases as well?

The second reason is to prevent people from playing games with
nicknames.  He gives an example where someone from THINK.COM wanted to
set up nicknames in such a way that replies to messages from any machine
in the THINK.COM subdomain would get routed back through their central
mail machine, which would then route the message to the recipients home
machine.  All I can say is that (a) there is another solution to this
particular problem (namely have the originating mailers include a
REPLY-TO line in the header), and (b) trying to limit the proliferation
of nicknames may not be the best way to prevent people from playing this
game, or many others.  The person who thought of this hack didn't
understand several points about the Internet mail system, and I'd
claim that increasing their understanding is the proper way to solve
this problem.

My final point is a political one.  There is a notion that the NIC
"delegates authority" to domain servers run by other organizations.
Now, we would clearly hope that the people who run these servers would
abide by the NIC's official policy regarding nicknames, but I wouldn't
be surprised if in practice they allow people to register as many
nicknames as they want.
