I am not convinced at all that the &lt;A--G--B&gt; argument makes the uses of
"% routing" mandatory. However, it is very near from the gateway problem
that we have more and more in Europe between X.400 and RFC-822 mail, and
whih boils generally to the "multiple gateway" problem.

Consider the following topology:

	NSFNET/INTERNET	----(expensive link)------European IP net 1 ----- The
local gateway to net 1
	|										|
	|								some less expensive link
	|										|
	----(another expensive link)-----The regular gateway --- European non
IP net 2---

Clearly, the MX records to Non-IP net 2 point to "the regular gateway".
No "%" hacking is needed, and the mail flows (slowly, and at a cost)
without requiring the NSFNET users to know the topology. But, then,
consider the case of the user in "European IP net 1": it sends mail,
which follows the MX records to the regular gateway, with the IP packets
crossing the Atlantic twice and possibly breaching the link usage
policy.. This is by no way a fictional example: it is exactly what will
happen when sending mail from say Sweden to the UK or to Switzerland, or
from France to the UK, if the routers were to follow exactly the DNS MX
records.

If we dont envisage a change in the network topology, like full European
IP interconnection, the solution is indeed that the "european IP net 1"
should not use the same routing information as the NSFNET/INTERNET. The
solution used here is to supercede the MX records with local routing
informations -- but this has clearly a high cost, as the extra info must
be replicated to all the hosts. There are other solutions, though, like:

1- Maintaining a local version of the DNS, storing records like:

	this-special-domain.our-view-of-the-world.here preference=5
our-own-gateway.here

and requesting all hosts within ".fr" to scan for that particular type
of MX before looking for he domain itself. Clearly, this is a kludge;
the only advantage is that we have swapped the distribution of tables
for the inclusion of one extra line in the configuration files + the
execution of one extra search in the DNS.

2- Using a special "scope" to qualify MX records, where the "scope"
qualifies an independant network. This is theoretically much neater than
(1), and was the original rationale for "scopes" in the DNS. However, it
has one major disadvantage: all records, whatever their "scope", must be
hold by the master of the domain, and cannot be easily updated by remote
network administrators.
