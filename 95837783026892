I know what the spec says, which is consistent with the design, which I
disagree with.  That's all nice theory.  What about practice?  I'm
running up against a wall.

In addition to the Internet class (with it's addresses and well known
services), I/Symbolics want to use other classes, such as chaosnet and
dialnet, which also have addresses and well known services.  (In theory,
there could be more, such as PUP, DECnet, XNS, etc.)  I'm having a hard
time figuring out how to make our machines get all this information from
the distributed (effectively only-Internet) domain database.

The part of in the domain system I disagree with is that the data for
the same name names but for different classes can be obtained by
different sets of servers (one set of servers per class).  The original
idea seemed to be for CSNET, but that was obsoleted a while ago
(rightfully) but the concept still remained.  For example, I contend
that all data for my machine, SWAN.SCRC.Symbolics.COM, should be
obtainable from the same single set of name servers, independent of
class.

There are some "bugs" in implementations that make this hard.  The name
server on SRI-NIC, when given a non-Internet qclass, responds with
FORMAT-ERROR.  The -only- difference between the query and an internet
query is the qclass value.  I believe it should give referals or
authoritative data, just as it would for QCLASS=Internet.  BIND, on the
other hand, response with REFUSED.  Neither of these are useful and are
just making my life harder.

What I'm contemplating doing sounds gross and disgusting, but I don't
see any alternative.  Can anybody help?  It seems that I have to first
search for some data in the IN class (such as host info, address, WKS).
Doing that will get me in touch with the necessary servers for the IN
class of data.  Then, violating the design, if I assume non-IN data
resides in the same servers, I can ask them for the non-IN data.  If all
of the registered servers respond with FORMAT-ERROR or REFUSED, then I
will respond to the query as if I got an authoritative no-data response.
And I will use the associated -Internet- SOA record as a timeout for the
non-Internet no-data.  Furthermore, I will try to cache which servers
don't like to talk about non-Internet data, and I will probably find
some appropriate -Internet- SOA record as a timeout on that cache.  I've
been banging my head against my desk for quite some time now trying to
figure out how to do all of this.  The special case kludges and trying
to avoid accidental recursion make for an ugly scene.

Is there a better way?  I think I brought up this general problem 1 or 2
years ago and got a mild response (I think reiterating the design of the
spec).  Well, this is a practical issue.  What should I do?  Should I go
ahead and by ugly and you folks should just be prepared to see
non-Internet requests from time to time?  Or should we change the spec
to say that all non-class-specific data is really not class specific and
all of its ramifications?  (I can probably enumerate what needs to be
done if this is a serious possibility.)
