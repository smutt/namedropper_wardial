As JJ notes, the general problem of an attribute-oriented information service
has been discussed for some time within CCITT and ISO and is the basis of the
about-to-be approved X.500 directory service.

One issue which came up clearly in the early IFIP 6.5 work and again in the
CCITT/ISO work is the problem of partitioning an attribute-oriented database.
(I won't elaborate on the reasons why you need to partition, they are the same
reasons for shifting from a hosts table to the domain name system:
decentralized administration, distribute the processing load, etc.)

Essentially, the only efficient way to partition an attribute oriented database
is by some particular attribute. -- e.g., the domain name system,which has two
attributes, name and network address, is partitioned by name components.
Imagine now that the attribute database is partitioned by name component and
you are trying to find a particular machine with attributes (processor=68000,
operating system=UNIX, registered users includes SIRBU).  Searching a
distributed database that was partitioned by host name component  for matches
with this set of attributes would be extremely costly.

Indeed recognition of this problem is why X.500 finally admitted the necessity
to include "Administrative Management Domain" as a key attribute in resolving
O/R names.

Alternatively, you must maintain multiple copies of the database, partitioned
by key search terms.  For example, the French national electronic directory is
actually replicated in triplicate.  One directory (the white pages) is
partitioned by last name/first name and can be used to find a telephone number
nationwide.  The other two are partitioned by Department (roughly the size of a
County in the U.S.), and then further subdivided by either street address or
profession (for yellow pages).  As a result, you cannot search for all entires
with profession="Dry Cleaners" and street="Ave St. Louis" without querying
every Departmental partition.

Similarly, the telephone operator assistance databases are partitioned by area
code and by "city".  Just try to get a phone number from the 617 operator for
John Doe, "someplace on Cape Cod"..

I conclude that we will need multiple hierarchies of servers, partitioned by
key attributes, one of which *must* occur in every search.
