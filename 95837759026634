On an experimental basis, the domain ATT.COM is now in the tree.
This is significant because we aren't on the ARPA Internet, so
there are MF entries for us.  Here's your chance to debug your
MF code in your resolvers.  (Actually, we are connected to the
DDN, as CSNET members, via BellCore, but the ARPA core gateways
already have more networks than slots, so we can only get as far
as BellCore before we get to places that can't get back.)

The ATT.COM domain is forwarded through seismo.CSS.GOV, which
will forward mail for ATT.COM to cbosgd.  cbosgd can route to
any NAC registered machine in AT&amp;T, such as "mark@cbosgd.ATT.COM"
which gets to user "mark" on machine "cbosgd".  We do not currently
do anything reasonable with "m.r.horton@ATT.COM" although we probably
should.

Here are some useful addresses for testing:
	mark@cbosgd.ATT.COM	Gets a real live person (me)
	nobody@cbosgd.ATT.COM	Goes into a black hole
	illegal@cbosgd.ATT.COM	Since there is no such user, you should
				get your mail bounced back to you.

I realize that 4.3BSD doesn't support MF yet in sendmail.  I understand
there are already one or two versions of sendmail that support MF, so
presumably it's only a matter of time before the official Berkeley copy
handles it.

Since this registration is experimental and also very new, cbosgd is
not sending out mail stamped cbosgd.ATT.COM, but is instead using its
better known name cbosgd.ATT.UUCP.  I realize that NIC has not registered
a UUCP domain (in fact, we didn't apply for one since we weren't sure
how we were going to configure our domains) but lots of places understand
that address (or else what seismo mungs it into) anyway.

The intention is that, eventually, other UUCP organizations will register
with the NIC using MF (or whatever it evolves into.)  Also, there are other
places that aren't reachable via SMTP (for example, BITNET and CSNET) which
would be handled well with MF.  So it's probably worthwhile to make sure
your mailers do the right thing with such entries.

By the way, cbosgd is [192.11.2.1] if anyone believes they can get to
us with TCP.  (And if you find a way, let me know!)
