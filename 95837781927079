Enclosed is the call for papers for the next ACM symposium on
communications architectures and protocols, to be held on August 16-18 in 
Stanford University.

I would like to encourage members of this list to let me or Prof.
Landweber know if there is interest in submissions of papers or panels
on naming/addressing/routing issues and design, analysis and
implementation of directory services in internetwork environments.

Please note the submission deadlines, and our student paper contest.

                              CALL FOR PAPERS
                        ACM SIGCOMM '88 SYMPOSIUM
                Communications Architectures and Protocols

                     Stanford University, California
                            August 16-18, 1988

The symposium provides an international forum for the presentation and
discussion of communication network applications and technologies, as
well as recent advances and proposals on communication architectures,
protocols, algorithms, and performance models.  Authors are invited to
submit full papers concerned with both theory and practice.  The areas
of interest for the symposium include, but are not limited to the
following: analysis and design of computer network architectures and
algorithms, innovative results in local area networks,
computer-supported collaborative work, network interconnection and
mixed-media networks, high-speed networks, resource sharing in
distributed systems, distributed operating systems and databases,
protocol specification, verification, and analysis.

Papers should be about 20 double-spaced pages long and should have an
abstract of 100-150 words.  All submitted papers will be reviewed and
will be judged with respect to their quality and relevance.  Authors of
selected papers will be expected to sign an ACM copyright release form.
The Proceedings will be distributed at the symposium and published as a
special issue of SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review.  A few of the
submitted papers will be selected for publication in the ACM
Transactions on Computer Systems.  

Submit 5 copies of each paper to the program chairman: Dr.  Lawrence H.
Landweber, Computer Sciences Department, University of
Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53706,
USA; Telephone: (608) 262-1204; EMAIL: lhl@parmesan.wisc.edu or 
landweber@cs.wisc.edu.
