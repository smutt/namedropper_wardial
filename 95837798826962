	   A quick hack would be to have a cron job on occasion which either
	   checks for the existance of critical processes &amp; start's 'em up.  Or
	   just start's em &amp; lets the processes fight over how many of which kind
	   are to be running.  Buuuut..
	
I think starting multiple nameds is a bad idea.  The second one finds
that the port is busy and hangs around doing nothing worthwhile.

	Ummmm....
	
	I would think that the right way of managing these things would be to
	embed into them some piece of SNMP (the Simple Network Management Protocol),
	and then have them all watched over by a network management station
	which could get traps when the daemons die, arrange to have things
	restarted, etc etc.  This would have the advantage of letting you watch
	over a bunch of systems from a single vantage point if you wanted to.
	
	That said, I must confess that I don't know whether anyone has stuck
	SNMP into bind (anyone?), whether there's a MIB defined, or anything
	like that.  I know that Sun doesn't ship it in SunOS 4.0.3, and that
	the DEC Ultrix 4.0 snmp/bind stuff appears to be amenable to such
	treatment but hasn't been done.

Ed,

That is the kind of thing that I was hoping to find out about.
Sending signals to named and using the returned status lacks
something in elegance.
