I took a look just now at our mail system's log of incoming messages
from the last three weeks or so.  Based on the return addresses given
in "MAIL FROM:" SMTP commands, it appears that quite a few hosts con-
tinue to use non-domain-style nicknames in their mail addresses -- even
though such nicknames are supposedly going to become unusable as hosts
convert from the NIC host name table to the domain servers/resolvers.

Here is the list I came up with.

    AERO2            CVL              MITRE-BEDFORD    RAND-UNIX
    AIDS-UNIX        GE-CRD           MITRE-GATEWAY    SEISMO
    ANL-MCS          GYMBLE           NCSC             SRI-UNIX
    BBNCCV           ISI-HOBGOBLIN    NOSC             TOVE
    BBNCD2           ISI-VAXA         NPRDC            UCI-ICSA
    BERKELEY         LBL-CSAM         NRL-CSS          UCI-ICSD
    CCA-UNIX         LLL-CRG          NTA-VAX          UCI-ICSE
    CIT-750          MARYLAND         NYU-CMCL2        UTAH-CS
    CIT-VAX          MIT-COMET        PLAYFAIR         YALE-APVAX

The hosts listed above represent roughly 1/3 of the incoming messages to
UCLA-LOCUS.ARPA during the last three weeks.  What really worries me is
that some very prominent, high-traffic hosts (in particular, BERKELEY
and SRI-UNIX) are evidently still using non-domain nicknames in the
return addresses of mail they generate.

Once everyone has switched completely over to the domain data base and
forsaken the NIC host name table, addresses like "someone@BERKELEY" are
going to be invalid.  But many people are going to find already that
mail from the above list of hosts is unreplyable -- since we were all
encouraged to start converting to the domain data base two months ago
and (at least in theory!) should all have finished said conversion by
next Monday (July 15).

Further, when lots of mail continues to come in with old-style return
addresses, this aggravates the problem of people trying to reply to mail
that's been sitting in their mailbox for a while.  However you may feel
about whether or not people should be able to reply to mail sent six
months or a year ago, a user should surely be able to reply to mail he
received a week ago -- or two days ago -- without having his reply
kicked back into his face on the grounds that the destination address
just became obsolete the other day!

For that matter, I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that some hosts
might be delaying their conversion to the new domain server/resolver
system specifically because so much incoming mail continues to use non-
domain host nicknames -- and it's much easier to just keep accepting
such names than to try to explain to a zillion naive users that the
return addresses on their incoming mail are invalid.

Comments?
