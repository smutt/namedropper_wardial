Pardon my side issue, but why are transmit-only addresses in the domain
database at all?  They can only cause trouble, since attempts to send to
them will fail.  Packets coming from them don't have this problem, since
the host knowns who it is and what its interface addresses are.  I see
the purpose of these records as announcing contact points, and a
transmit-only interface is not a contact point.

I realize that it is useful to be able to do an inverse query to display
in human-readable format where the packet are coming from.  It might
even happen that mailers get the A records for the host in the HELO
record and compare.

Supporting the send-only addresses for inverse queries only would be a
good way to deal with this problem.  In particular, supporting the
addresses for the IN-ADDR domain could provide for network level
debugging and tracing.  Not all the domain servers implement inverse
queries and/or the IN-ADDR domain, and those that do may not find it
convenient to make this change, but it could be useful.  Such an
addition to the spec deserves at least brief consideration.

I don't think that this would be incompatible in the field.  MIT-Multics
sees a lot of mail, and there are still mailers out there which send
non-domain addresses in their HELO records.  Attempts to verify such
names will likely fail.  For this and other reasons I don't think it
likely that a serviceable implementation can be depending on reverse
resolution for some sort of mail security.  Thus, the removal of the
offending A RRs from the database should not deny service to the hosts
in question.

If the security issues involving gateway, host and user authentication
are better dealt with in the future, and the designers provide and
require secure domain server implementations, then a new RR type can be
invented to give out the transmit only addresses.  I don't expect this
to be needed.
