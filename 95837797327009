	What comes to A records, those could well point to nonconnected hosts
	prodived that there always is at least one MX record pointing to a
	connected one.  

We have several MX records listed.  Some hosts (mostly those in Europe,
and to some extent Australia) can deliver mail to us directly.  Other
hosts go via the Fnet mail gateway, inria.inria.fr.  This works quite
well, since the INRIA people do a hell of a job keeping availability
up (especially in the light of scarce resources and uncooperative
carriers).

You have to be careful with the term "connected", since it is relative
to where you stand.  I can reach many German hosts, but no US hosts.
Am I connected?  Are they?
	
	Finally, it should be possible to register in-addr.arpa domains for
	nonconnected networks (if the first paragraph holds), but so far
	hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil has refused to do so.

Yes, we were stung by this also.  I couldn't use remote resources
because many sites couldn't "authenticate" (ahem, such as it is) our
host (via the .rhosts hack).  I'm still a little irrate about the
US-centric or "cultural imperialism" that someone recently mentioned
about the NIC.  If you can register in a domain (whether your name-
servers are reachable from the NIC or not), you should be able to
register in the in-addr.arpa domain as well (in fact, it should be
required that you register this within some short interval after
getting your network number assigned, since many sites don't bother
to do this).  [Paul &amp; Jon:  what is the latest word on this from the
Powers That Be?]

There is no ARPAnet "backbone" anymore, and the US shouldn't be
considered the backbone for the international Internet that is
growing.

If the domain name system is supposed to give distributed authority
for naming, why do I still feel that this NIC holds all the cards?
