Declaring myself as the authority for the .BITNET and .UUCP
pseudo-domains has the same consequences as the widespread practice
declaring oneself the authority for the .0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain.
There are only two circumstances in which some other machine would see
any of the "illegitimate" RRs carried by my domain server:

    1) the other machine is configured as a secondary server (to my
       primary) for one or both of these two pseudo-domains;

    2) the other machine is configured to use mine as a forwarder.

Both of these circumstances require deliberate actions on the part of
the other machine's administrator, and I will not be held accountable
if the administrator of some random site makes such a configuration
change without understanding the consequences or consulting me
beforehand.

All I have done is taken information that used to be in my sendmail.cf
file and moved it into the domain system -- where I feel it more
properly belongs.  It is now somewhat easier for other sites to access
this information, and that is either a bug or a feature depending on
one's point of view.  Note that to make things difficult for other
sites to really use my pseudo-domains the NS records list "localhost."
as the nameserver.  I remain unconvinced that it is now so easy to use
this information that it will, in fact, inadvertently be misused.

&gt; 	If you doubt my contentions, ask most any host that makes heavy
&gt; use of the domain name system for its list of root name servers.  The
&gt; list will almost always include several obsolete or completely bogus
&gt; entries

These bogus RRs result from zone administrators wrongly putting lines
such as:

     .     IN     NS     SRI-NIC.ARPA.

into the file that defines their zone.  Any primary or secondary
server for such a zone will then list SRI-NIC.ARPA as a root
nameserver along with the legitimate root nameservers.  Observe that
the secondary servers for my registered domain do not resolve anything
in my pseudo-domains.  If *they* don't inadvertently have the
illegitimate RRs, I doubt anybody will.
