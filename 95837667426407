I got involved in a similar conversation last night. I asserted that it
would be useful/necessary to write completion routines, not unlike
Twenex filename completion, for hostnames, that would somehow reach out
to the domain nameservers and help users along. This is (perhaps) easy
to do within the local domain, but more difficult for the domain system
at large, since you (seem to) need to do a broadcast lookup for partial
strings.

For example, I like being able to just "telnet mc" and not have to
worry about the fact that it is/will be "mc.mit.edu" (probably); it is
also a fairly simple example. Long domains names work well as long as
they are embedded in mail alias or mailinglist files; they are
difficult for users to use directly.

One suggestion that we ran across was that the top-level domain servers
periodically request the complete contents of all the subordinate
domain servers' translation tables. Thus, you could send a request all
the way up the tree and get a response that contained all partial
matches, without requiring a broadcast for every partial match query.
This would require a relatively large amount of storage at the top
level servers, but would minimize net traffic required for this
functionality. The user could then choose a name and use the normal
sequence of events to do the name to address translation; the top level
server would only maintain the list of names, not all the corresponding
addresses.

It isn't clear to me how easily this functionality can be added to the
existing spec.
