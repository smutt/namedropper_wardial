 OCE.ORST.EDU (also known as neptune.OCE.ORST.EDU) is a Sun (I think
360) in the Oceanography dept. of Oregon State University. It is running
a SunOs that doesn't have a nameserver, but was "given" an unsupported
named by someone at Sun.

  As the hostmaster for ORST.EDU, I have been trying to get it to serve
as the name server for its own department (they change their machines so
often that I can't keep up!) and so was very glad that they were finally 
running a one. It looks like I get to take that task back until they get
a less buggy version. ( I will do some queries, of course... ).

 I had noticed a bit of a problem with transfering data from their server
the master servers on orstcs.CS.ORST.EDU and chroma.CS.ORST.EDU but thought
that I had just made a minor error and I just didn't have time to look into
it. Perhaps this is the problem. I will send a note to SRI-NIC.ARPA asking
that OCE.ORST.EDU be removed as a valid nameserver for ORST.EDU until
we get the problem fixed. (Of course I will also forward a copy of
the note and this responce to the person responsible at OCE.)

 Thank you for telling us about the problem.

 p.s. The reason you couldn't reach us is that most of the time our
link with the rest of the world via NSFNet/UCAR is down. I don't know why,
but if any one has a theory I would sure love to hear it.
