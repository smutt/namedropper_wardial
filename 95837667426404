I disagree with Jon.  My experience so far is that nicknames are crucial.
It is true that nobody will bother with A.ISI.USC.EDU as opposed to
ALPHA.ISI.USC.EDU, but it's equally true that people will quickly become
fed up with typing A.ISI.USC.EDU.  They want to type A and be done with it.
When you have a cluster of machines on an Ethernet and you spend a lot of
time moving from one machine to another or moving files around, you make
a lot of references to the other machine.  They aren't going to be willing
to type the whole domain string out for long until they look for a short cut.

Remember that we are moving from a system of short names to a system of
much longer names.  There is going to be public resistance to this move,
it's hard to convince the users that we're running out of naming space
for 3-10 character names.  Of course, the real issue is maintenence of
the data, but try to explain this to a user who has never tried to keep
a registry up to date.  In order to combat this resistance, we need to
do things to make it relatively easy for users to get their jobs done.

There are lots of other examples out there that have local nicknames or
local abbreviations.  PBX systems let you just dial a 4 digit extension.
You don't dial the area code for local phone calls.  When you look up an
address in the phone book, it won't have the city, state, country, and
zip code on it.  The post office will accept mail to "John Smith, 123
Main St, City" where "City" is an abbreviation for the local city, state,
and zip code.  Other networks mostly use simple names (because they are
small enough to handle it trivially.)  Datakit has 3 level heirarchical
names like CB/DK/OSGD but lets you type OSGD or DK/OSGD if the top parts
of the address are the local names.

I suspect that nicknames will move from the officially distributed top level
name tables, to locally hidden and implementation dependent entities.  As
long as the nickname gets fully expanded by the time any nonlocal entity
sees it, there's no problem.  But local users are going to insist on
nicknames.

Let's all be sure that as we introduce local nicknames, we educate our
users that these nicknames all have only local significance.  I get phone
calls sometimes from users at the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ site.
I ask them what machine they are on, and they tell me "purple".  What
they really mean is houxp, where the 'p' stands for "purple".  Holmdel
nicknamed their computers after colors.

On the other hand, the same user would never think of calling me in Ohio
from his New Jersey office and leaving a message to call "Joe Blow at
extension 4522".  They know better than this, since phone extensions
are well understood by most of the general public.  (There are, of course,
a few morons out there who can't even handle this right, but they are rare.)

It is clear that users don't even understand the current convenentions
for computer naming, because they are relatively new and not well documented.
The domain scheme is even newer and even we don't completely understand it
yet.  The users are going to want to do things like signing their mail
SMITH@A, or mention that somebody elses address is JONES@B, and they will
expect people to understand it, unless we educate them properly
about what the overall name space looks like and what a local nickname is.
Presumably all of you are producing some sort of tutorial documentation
for your domain software, please be sure to make these issues clear, if
you have any support for local nicknames.
