    I've been re-reading the RFC's and noticed that it is apparently
legal for a host to have both an MF and an MD record.  I find this
a bit confusing.  If a mailer gets both an MD and an MF for a single
host which one is it supposed to use? If it always prefers one over
the other, then listing both an MD and an MF is clearly wrong or at least
a bad idea (since one or the other gets ignored).  But if the mailer
is supposed to make some intelligent choice between the two choices,
can anyone tell me how that choice should be made?

    I've been trying to think of why one would want both an MD and
an MF and have come up with two examples. They are:

    1.  Just to describe the true mail situation.  For example,
    anyone at BBN.COM can be reached by mailing to them at UNIX.BBN.COM
    (or indeed to almost any host in BBN.COM).  Thus one might
    list a host as accepting mail itself (MD) or as reachable thru
    some of the BBN.COM. hosts (MF).   I think this practice should
    be discouraged, since it is not clear that the MF record is
    useful.

    2.  To deal with intermittent links.  Imagine, for example, a
    host (A) which is only reachable during certain hours from the Internet
    (or only reachable thru a single gateway, or experimental link)
    but which also has a direct link to another Internet host (B).
    Here one might list A as being its own MD, but also list B as
    an MF.  Here one would want a mailer to try to reach A, and failing
    that, immediately send the mail on to B for forwarding, so B
    can promptly pass the mail to A.

    Note that a mailer's behaviour in the two situations is likely to
be different.  In case 1, the MF is simply another way to reach a host
you can always reach directly.  As such, the mailer should probably
ignore the MF as not useful (if you can't reach the host it is because
the host is probably down, and passing the mail on to the MF isn't
going to change this situation).  In case 2, the MF record is very useful --
it allows mail to reach the desired host faster.  Other examples
may produce other results.  Anybody got any idea what a poor mailer
is supposed to do about this?
