Mark Horton describes in gory detail how attempting to use a name server
approach via mail over dial up lines is totally crazy.  I never 
suggested otherwise, and i don't think anyone else did.  I don't know 
how the people in uucp land plan to convert domain style names to route 
information, but i don't expect them to try to use domain name servers 
via computer mail sent over dial up lines!

I expect that each host has some information about the names and routes 
to other hosts it talks to frequently.  I don't expect any host to have 
total knowledge of all the other hosts in the world.

Mark makes an assumption about what a host should do with mail it does 
not know what to do with (i.e., the name is not in the local table), he 
says the host should give it to its "domain parent".  To me, this is not
at all obvious.  (I am not sure that every node of the domain name tree 
necessarily has a host associated with it.)  Certainly, if a host has 
some mail that it does not know what to do with it should give it to 
some smarter host.  The lines of communication, especially within a 
protocol family or communication scheme need not have anything to do 
with the domain name structure.

I can imagine a host connected to the world only via the uucp 
communication scheme that for perverse reasons known only to its owners 
is called "NO-TECH.EDU".  This host may know about some other uucp 
capable hosts in its neighborhood and be able to directly exchange mail 
with them using uucp.  But, this host may not have much knowledge of the
wider world and when asked to send mail to some host it never heard of 
(say "F.ISI.USC.EDU", or "Q.CC.BBN.COM", or even "CBOSGD.ATT.UUCP"), it 
punts by sending the mail to one of the hosts it does know that is 
smarter about the wider world.   These other neighborhood hosts may be 
known by any kind of domain style names, for example, they may be in the
EDU domain, or the COM domain, or even the UUCP domain.

This assumes that at some point this messages gets forwarded to a host 
that does know the destination host and has it its tables a routing 
procedure for that destination.  This does not require that there be 
some smartest host that knows everything.  The knowledge can be 
subdivided and portions stored in  a number of hosts.  It may help to 
divide the knowledge according to the naming structure.  For example, 
some host in the uucp communication scheme may take responsibility for 
knowing all the uucp capable hosts in the EDU domain.  If some message 
for a host in the EDU domain is forwarded to this host it can either 
route it to the destination via uucp, possibly route it to the 
destination via some other communcation scheme, or may not know of the 
destination at all.  In the last case, this host may forward the message
to a relay that interconnects the uucp communcation scheme with other 
communication schemes (e.g., BITNET, MAILNET, CSNET, ARPA-Internet), the
relay must attempt to find a way to route to the destination host in the
other communication schemes.

I think it is possible that if the source host and the destination host 
are in the same communication scheme (e.g., uucp), that even though 
their names have no obvious relationship  (e.g., NO-TECH.EDU and 
HI-TEK.COM) a message can be delivered from one to the other without 
leaving that comminication scheme.

I don't think there is any evidence that "two disjoint TCP/IP networks 
just don't work well".  The ARPA world (ARPANET and connected nets) and 
the DDN world (MILNET and connected nets) are interconnected because the
users in the two worlds have a strong need to share information, not 
because there is any flaw in the protocols that makes separation 
difficult.

I really like the idea that the users of the uucp communication scheme 
are  going to join together to have some coherent management.  I think 
it is great that this management is exploring the various possible ways 
to set up additional internal structure, based on various criteria.  I 
would like to point out that i think it is not likely that this 
management can force every host that has the uucp capability to use a 
name that ends in ".UUCP".  If a host, X, at ISI, is uucp capable, its 
name is going to be X.ISI.USC.EDU.  If some other uucp capable host has 
message to send to this host X there had better be a way of doing the 
message routing entirely within the uucp communication scheme.

The conceptual problem i see is that some people still can't separate 
the arbitrary administrative domain style names from communication 
schemes.  Where this causes real problems is at the edges, where the 
different communication schemes overlap.  I think it is really important
that a host have exactly one official name that is used consistently on 
all messages originated at that host.  There are lots of reasons for 
this.

I think the main point i'd like to make to the designers of naming and 
routing mechanisms for communication schemes (e.g., uucp, bitnet, 
mailnet, csnet (phone net), whatever) is:

   If your "name to route" procedure includes the assumption that every 
   host in your communication scheme has a name ending in a constant 
   string (e.g., UUCP, BITNET, MAILNET, CSNET, WHATEVER), then you 
   should go back to the drawing boards -- the names you have to deal 
   with are completely arbitrary.
