In the process of making recommendations for sites that want to
forward mail between UUCP and ARPA, a fairly tricky problem has
come up.  I wonder if people on this list have already solved this,
or have any suggestions.

Consider a machine which is on N networks, especially where N &gt; 2.
(HARVARD.HARVARD.EDU is on ARPA, CSNET, UUCP, and BITNET, for example.
DECWRL.DEC.COM is on ARPA, ENET, and UUCP.  There are no doubt more.)

This machine gets a message for foo@bar.mumble.com.  It has to figure
out which of the N networks to drop the message into.  The syntax of
the message gives no clue, in accordance with the spirit of domains.

The machine has at its disposal a lookup routine for each network that
it's on.  For ARPA, it has a resolver.  For UUCP, it has a pathalias
lookup routine that looks in a local disk file.  I don't know what CSNET,
BITNET, and ENET provide, but I would guess they involve looking in a disk
file.

Each network routine might respond with one of the following answers:

(a) That name is on my network, and I can send to it directly.

(b) That name is reachable through my network, and I can forward to
another host that will get it there.

(c) I never heard of that name.

For each of the names "bar.mumble.com", "mumble.com", and "com", you
may get a different answer to the above.  In particular, for "com",
you'll almost certainly not get answer (c) from any network.

OK, now so much for theory.  In practice, we have to deal with things
like this:

(1) You might get (a) back from more than one network, if the remote
destination is on both networks.  Then you have to order the nets so
you'll pick the best one.  If it's up.

(2) Some networks may not be able to distinguish between (a) and (b).
UUCP, in particular, can't tell the difference easily.

(3) I don't know of any software that even attempts to deal with this
at the current time.

(4) I don't know what CSNET, BITNET, ENET, and EAN do.

Any information about possible solutions, and about how this might be
handled for some of the other networks, would be appreciated.

					not supporting RFC 973/974!)
	mark@cbosgd.UUCP		(if you don't understand the above.)
