Over the past couple months, I have seen sri-nic.arpa, brl-aos.arpa
and gunter-adam.arpa (yes, I mean the old names for these hosts)
being listed as root servers.  I found one source of these and it
seems to have been fixed, but there must be others.  What prompted
this note was receiving these from one of the root servers today.

Having these addresses in the cache cause BIND to send out one query
per bogus server every time a query is forwarded to the root.  BIND
is trying to get an address for these servers, but there are only
CNAME records.  According to the RFCs, all NS records are supposed
to point to the canonical name, but these addresses are violatiing
this requirement.

My guess is that these address are originating on hosts running old
versions of BIND and loading an incorrect list of root servers.  These
then get propogated from there by servers not being able to answer a
query that was refered to them.  I realize that BIND should really
be fixed to be less trusting in what it adds to its cache but that
won't do anyting about those people running 2 year old software.


On a different note, is there anything that can be done about the root
servers having three different versions of the root domain according to
their SOA records.
