Kent:

    The number one problem to look for is for a host on your system
continuously sending queries, or a server dying under a continuous
stream.  SUN YP apparently fires a continuous stream of queries at
its server, which then proceeds to blast at the appropriate server for
the domain name being investigated.  True disaster strikes if the
appropriate server isn't serving.  There's a well-known case last
fall where a site in the Midwest had listed a server they expected
to have on-line soon, and a workstation in Hawaii concluded that server
was the *righti* one to query.  Some huge fraction (like 40%) of the
NSFNET backbone for two days was caused by that workstation trying
over-zealously to contact the non-existent server.

    Two morals to this tale:  (1) SUN has an Internet bugfix for SUN
YP -- I don't know the ID to request (sorry!).  Install it.  (2) Make
sure that the servers for your domain are properly listed with the NIC
and running.  Don't list servers which aren't live.  (Note that NIC
doesn't check servers for you -- when you send your request in,
you are certifying that everything works).

    Another key problem is that many domain servers don't do exponential
backoff on retransmissions.  So, for long distance queries, you have
a multiplier effect.  Instead of 1 or 2 queries, you get 10 or 20,
all for the same info.  Given that problem #1 is more severe, this problem
has not been pursued as hard as it might.  But the Host Requirements
RFC requires exponential backoff, so help is on the way.

    Finally, I've heard tell (from Jim Bloom) of problems with resolvers
sending to broadcast addresses on networks where most of the workstations
run servers.  Voila, meltdown on the entire path to the appropriate
server to answer the question.  (Each server hears the broadcast query,
and tries to answer it.  Local ethernet promptly floods.  Local gateway
gets swamped, those queries that get through blast remote server...).
This problem is still being investigated for a clean solution.
