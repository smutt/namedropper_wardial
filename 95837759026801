I leave "trails" specifically ... for instance, all of my NASA accounts
point at one machine, and from there they get forwarded to Berkeley
these days (when I was there full time over the summer, that was
different, but now that I'm back at school) ... this way, if I want to
stop the flow, I can remove just one .forward file -- also, I have
accounts at various places behind multiple gateways and lots of mail
would simply time out if it needed to direct deliver to my home mailbox
each time. This is also my gripe about the "mail machine" approach. You
only need to have your local mail software claim that your return
address is that machine (Athena does this, UCLA does this, etc.).
Workstations are prone to unreliable service and are like to be "far
away" in terms of network topology. Seems like having an SMTP process
hop your mail around is a cheap price to pay for getting the mail
through.

I maintain that where your mail goes is a private issue, not one that a
network service would specifically go and track down.

Also, I think your argument of "less overhead" will fall apart if
everyone writes mailers that go querying around for everyones home
mailbox ...  network overhead will pile up, not only from the domain
server activity, but increased retransmissions for all the hosts having
to send their SMTP packets further in one shot too ... I think it's not
at all clear that the overhead issue is straightforward.
