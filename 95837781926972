I would rather see the more effective solution of negative cacheing being used
then hacks that increase the amount of data you have to manage and don't
really solve the problem.

Negative cacheing wins many times over for the end user especially in the
current fragile Internet which is not doing too well in the reliability
area because of congestion, routing screw ups and outages. It goes under
the section in the latest domain RFC of running with what you got. Of course
it contradicts the section that says the source of the information controls
the lifetime of the information....if you obey the latter and lose
connectivity....your service level drops significantly.

Maybe the domain system people believe the Internet should be as reliable as
the old Bell system and it will happen soon...if that is the case they should
change their beliefs....it is not going to happen that soon...the subtle
complexities of networking are very slowly spreading in the Internet world --
look at debate between token ring and base band, at the confusion with MAP and
the lack of compatability and completeness with the ISO protocols. A large
number of the people involved in these issues are using TCP/IP and they
still don't understand TCP/IP issues.

The experience level gained by many people that have implemented and maintain
parts of the domain system should now be used to design and implement the next
generation of the domain system protocol and it should be happening now.  It
is possible that the reason that this is not happening is because of fear that
a new version would divide the people moving to the domain system and create
confusion. With a global view, this is probably very true but if the next
generation protocol is in developement and in the radical change
stage...vendors and other software suppliers will not bother with using the
protocol until people start recomending and demanding its usage...and the
developers can control that.

For the duration, a hack should be designed and documented for negative
cacheing. First level hack, would be to have everyone to pick 12 hours or some
value to use for a negative TTL.  Second level hack would be to either add an
RR that gives a negative TTL or to add a bit to the header in the request that
says an extended domain header is allowed to be sent back with a negative TTL
before the QDCOUNT field. Overall, the domain system design goals should be
made less contradictory and a new protocol should be designed based on the
goals. A frank analysis of current and future internet expectations should
be included with time frames and should include expectations for networks
like BITNET and UUCP.

We need the hack now for negative cacheing....let us pick a value and move
on with learning about this first generation domain system. Believing that
the first release of a system is the last is fatal.

Cheers,
-Rudy
