Isn't the "right" way to handle the THINK.COM situation to use MB records?
These provide the desired feature of mailing to domains that aren't the
names of hosts.  Craig Partridge's recent solution (MX records for
THINK.COM pointing to the hosts that will relay the mail for it) is the
closest approximation using MX records, which are preferable until MB gets
more support; and in fact it looks like a better way to specify the
redirection of mail for entire domain rather than anything MB provides.

The attempt to use CNAMEs fails to satisfy the axiom that the domain named
by a CNAME record must not have any other sort of record.  It is very
confusing to say, on the one hand, that THINK.COM is a real domain, i.e.,
the parent of GODOT.THINK.COM and all the other names in it, and on the
other hand that THINK.COM is not a real domain but a nickname for
something else, which is what the CNAME means.

This brings up another question in my mind: are CNAMEs useful at other
than the bottom level of the domain tree?  E.g., if SU.EDU were made a
CNAME for Stanford.EDU and someone tried to use the domain SAIL.SU.EDU,
would this be translatable to SAIL.Stanford.EDU?  This would be useful,
but you can see that it would break down with THINK.COM as a CNAME for
RELAY.THINK.COM because there would be no way to normalize this name;
there is a potential infinite loop.  (Detectable, if you're careful.)
