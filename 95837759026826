Rich,

1) The "UCL special case" only applies to hosts.txt, which does
not allow for assymetrical forward/reverse mappings.
With the domain server scheme, A mappings are FORWARD only.
All reverse mappings (internet address to domain) should be
done by use of the IN-ADDR.   There are times whne this
assymetry is useful, and so the new scheme is a win in this
respect.

2) It is clearly useful for domain servers to preserve order on
records, as it can be useful in making choices.

3) Routing.   This is really a fundamental Internet issue.
Basically, internet addresses consist of a Network/SNPA
(Subnetwork Point of Attachement) pair.  In some cases,
networks are allocated hierarchically.   Where a host has
multiple SNPAs (possibly on multiple networks), it is allocated
an internet address for each.   Domain -&gt; IP address binding is
done at the source.   In cases where there are multiple choices
of SNPA, this also has to be done at source.   This is clearly
a problem, as in many cases it is not possible for the source
to make an optimum choice.   There would be quite a bit to be
said for the ISO approach of giving each host a single globally unique
NSAP (Network Service Access Point), with late binding to Network/SNPA.
This would allow for more intelligent intermediate routing.
However, this is a basic Internet issue, and is not going to be
solved by a bit of twiddling with the Domain Servers.
I would like to hear some comments from Jon Postel et al?


Steve


PS Before any one comments, I note that ISO do not have a
suitable routing directory scheme to go with their naming
architecture.
