   The second reason is to prevent people from playing games with
   nicknames.  He gives an example where someone from THINK.COM wanted to
   set up nicknames in such a way that replies to messages from any machine
   in the THINK.COM subdomain would get routed back through their central
   mail machine, which would then route the message to the recipients home
   machine.  All I can say is that (a) there is another solution to this
   particular problem (namely have the originating mailers include a
   REPLY-TO line in the header), and (b) trying to limit the proliferation
   of nicknames may not be the best way to prevent people from playing this
   game, or many others.  The person who thought of this hack didn't
   understand several points about the Internet mail system, and I'd
   claim that increasing their understanding is the proper way to solve
   this problem.

   -------
I don't remember the message you are referring to, but I wouldn't
exactly call what I am doing as ``playing games'' with nicknames.  All
I wanted was to have the name THINK.COM, the root name of our site
domain, be mapped to a host so that someone could send mail here
without having to know any particular local host names (or spellings
or forms (like UCB-VAX vs UCBVAX)).  If someone wants to send mail to
me, he shouldn't need to know whether my mailbox is on Godot or
Aquinas, or even that either of those hosts exist.  All he should care
about is that I'm Bruce at Thinking Machines.  Our mailers don't yet
accept "Bruce Nemnich" or "B.J. Nemnich" as mailboxes, but they
should.  How the mapping is done between Thinking Machines Corporation
and THINK.COM is also unclear, but at least both those peices of
information can be found in the nicname database for now.

Yes, THINK.COM is also the host we put on "From:" headers from other
machines here, so if I want to change which machine is acting as the
local mail clearinghouse for a day (the usual one might be down), I
can (ignoring the people who still use HOSTS.TXT).  Or if I want to
permanently change it, I doesn't screw people responding to month-old
mail, which otherwise might go to the obsolete name.  The idea is to
make it as simple as possible on the outside and as flexible as
possible on the inside by guaranteeing one constant ``site name'' and
presenting only that to the outside world.

Anyway, is someone really suggesting that we limit the number of
nicknames within our distributed domain databases?  I was under the
impression that it was for the sake of HOSTS.TXT and those who use it.

p.s.--What don't you think I understand about the Internet mail
system?  Respond privately if it doesn't conern the group.
