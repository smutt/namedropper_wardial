     I'm more than a little confused about what I should do next and
could use some advice on how to procede:

     Ames-nas is a gateway to a class C network (ames-nas-net) and is
homed on net 26.  It is one of two networks here at Ames, the other
belonging to a seperate organization within Ames.

     We have obtained and made partially operational the Berkeley name
server / resolver code "BIND" and are technically ready to start
experimenting with being a subdomain.

     Herein lies my problem:  Ames is a NASA research center, and
currently the only NASA site directly attached to the network.  Of
course, eventually other NASA sites will come onto the net.

     I realize that the issues I am about to raise need to be solved
within NASA, but I am interested in opinions and technical aspects of
how others within the community are handling them:

     I assume that eventually, NASA will be a subdomain of (GOV?, MIL?,
ARPA?) that AMES will be a subdomain of NASA and that we (NAS) will be
a subdomain of AMES.  However, we're ready to start now, AMES as a
whole will be somewhat behind us, and NASA as a domain probably won't
occur until there are multiple centers on the net.

     The question is: do we start out being the NAS domain as a
subdomain of one of the top level domains, become NAS.AMES.TOP when
AMES as a whole is ready and eventually become NAS.AMES.NASA.TOP when
NASA becomes a domain; do we take the opposite extreme of being all of
those domains at once (provided we can find peers etc.) and then give
over authority as the rest of NASA becomes available; or is there a
different course of action?
