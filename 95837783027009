&gt; My memory was that it had been assigned to an existing WG.  Phill?

Unfortunately, no.  With the Domain group inactive, there is currently
no group dealing with this issue explicitly.

I renew my question to this mailing list -- Are there folks interested
in joining an IETF Working Group to deal with this (and other) Domain
issues?  For those of you unfamiliar with the IETF, I'll include below
an article from the Sept issue of the ACE Connexions newsletter (this
issue was distributed to all attendees of Interop 88).

History
.PP
DARPA originally formed the Internet Activities Board (IAB) to 
to oversee and coordinate work under DARPA's Internet Research
Program.  It was decided to organize ``Task Forces'' in various
areas of interest, such as Gateway Algorithms, End-to-End Services,
and Privacy.  The chairs of these Task Forces together would compose
the core of the IAB itself.  Dr. David Clark (MIT), chairs the IAB and
Dr. Jon Postel (ISI) is the vice-chair.  Since the IAB had the 
responsibility for the Internet protocol architecture, Clark and Postel
also carry the weighty titles of The Internet Architect and the Deputy
Internet Architect, respectively.  In keeping with their mission of 
overseeing the Internet Research Program, the IAB's Task Forces all had a 
distinctly research-oriented flavor.  
.PP
It wasn't long, however, before the IAB's success caught up with it.  There 
should be no need to relate here how the Internet has grown in both size 
and importance in recent years.  Along with this growth and success came 
a subtle shift in the IAB's responsibilities.

.LP
Evolution
.PP
Before long, the IAB grew into the coordinating committee of the Internet,
with responsibility to oversee new protocol specification.  In addition, 
the original DARPA emphasis broadened out to include other agencies, 
such as DCA and NSF.  Even more recently, five agencies (DARPA, DOE, HHS, 
NASA, NSF) have joined together to form the Federal Research Internet 
Coordinating Committee (FRICC).  The goal of the FRICC is to pursue 
the networking recommendations laid out by the congressionally-chartered
Federal Coordinating Committee on Science, Engineering and Technolgy 
(FCCSET).  The FCCSET recommendations include building a high-speed 
national internet within five years.  It was natural for the FRICC to 
turn to the IAB for coordination and guidance in their efforts.
.PP
Therefore, the IAB now has wide agency involvement and has established 
liasons with other R&amp;D bodies.  Throughout all this growth and evolution, 
the Task Forces of the IAB, for the most part, have been successful in 
maintaining their forward-looking research orientation.
.PP
However, one Task Force was particularly hard hit by the growth in the 
Internet.  The original mission of the Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures
Task Force (GADS), chaired by Dr. David Mills (University of Delaware),
was to pursue research topics at the Internet layer, such as Internet routing.
Even at its early meetings, the group found itself diverted from
advanced topics to deal with more operational problems like how to
adapt EGP for a large, diverse, operational Internet.
.PP
It soon became clear that another group was needed
with a nearer-term focus.  Finally, at the IAB meeting in January 1986, it 
was decided to divide the GADS group into the Internet Architecture Task 
Force (INARC) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The 
Architecture TF maintained the original research mission with Dave Mills 
as chair, while the IETF absorbed the nearer-term engineering and technology 
transfer responsibilities.  Mike Corrigan (OASD, then Technical Program 
Manager for DDN) was the original chair of the IETF.

.LP
IETF Charter
.PP
The IETF was given the charter to identify and coordinate solutions
for problems in the management, engineering,
and operations of the Internet.  Furthermore, the IETF would act to
identify problems in the Internet protocol architecture,
recommend near-term and mid-term approaches, and help coordinate 
prototyping efforts.  In summary, the IETF would not be concerned with 
longer-term research topics, concentrating instead on nearer-term
operational issues and mid-term protocol R&amp;D issues that would have a high 
operational payoff without significant changes to the basic architecture.

.LP
Second Evolution
.PP
At first, the IETF meetings felt very much like the old GADS meetings,
since many of the issues and participants were the same.  With continued
growth, in particular with the advent of the original NSFnet, the IETF
began to develop a much larger constituency.  Gateway vendors for
the various NSF regional networks began to attend.  Finally in March 1987,
the NSFnet Routing Group joined forces with the IETF, approximately
doubling its size at that time, and the format was reorganized to
take on its current structure.  
.PP
When Mike Corrigan moved to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (OASD), the IAB invited the author to chair the group.
It was around this period -- spurred by the merger with the NSFnet 
Routing Group -- that the IETF
began its real growth toward becoming a forum for government agencies, 
contractors, university researchers, vendors, network users, and 
industry R&amp;D labs.

.LP
New Format
.PP
After the NSFnet group joined, IETF meetings essentially became open forums.
With this increased size and scope, it was necessary for the IETF to develop 
a structure of its own.  Specific problem areas within the IETF are now 
addressed by ``Working Groups''.
.PP
There were originally three Working Groups--Routing,
Domains, and Performance.  In yet another measure of growth, there
are now 18 Working Groups.  Five separate groups grew out of
the original routing group.  These include efforts to improve the
current EGP, to investigate a successor to EGP, to prototype an
open IGP based on the proposed ANSI routing standard, and a routing
advisory group for operational networks.
.PP
Other important IETF Working Groups that have received attention lately
include Internet Host Requirements (an effort, chaired by Bob Braden
of ISI, to define a standard host protocol operations; this will be a host
analog to RFC 1009), CMIP-Over-TCP (CMOT) Network Management (chaired
by Lee LaBarre of MITRE; to specify and prototype the use of ISO CMIP
for network management within the Internet architecture), SNMP Extensions
(chaired by Marshall Rose of TWG; to explore and define possible
extensions to SNMP, as specified in RFC 1052), 
Internet Management Information Base (MIB) (chaired by Craig Partridge of BBN;
to define an Internet standard MIB for both CMOT and SNMP), and
Serial Line IP (SLIP) (with three co-chairs; to specify the standard
usage of IP over serial links).
.PP 
Many of the early Working Groups were established by the IETF chair.  More 
and more, however, interested parties are asking to form Working Groups 
under the auspices of the IETF.  The SLIP and CMOT groups fall into this 
category, as do other groups on Public Data Network (PDN) routing, Telnet, 
and Internet authentication.  It is probably fair to consider the RFC 
1052-spawned groups on network management in this category, too.  This 
is a new and promising trend and it indicates to me that activities under 
the IETF are taking on a life of their own.  
.PP
For those who feel they have an issue that might be profitably addressed
in this way, the rules for starting a Working Group are quite simple.  First, 
the organizer must write a fairly narrow charter stating the goals and 
expected duration of the group.  This will help both to justify the group 
and to measure its progress.  Then, collect a reasonably small set of 
active core participants and carry on electronic mail discussions or 
hold separate meetings to work on the issue.  Finally, produce an RFC 
or working paper to document the effort.  Working Groups are also expected 
to report their progress at the IETF plenary meetings and to contribute 
written status reports to the IETF Proceedings.

.LP
IETF Plenary Meetings
.PP
The IETF holds plenary meetings four times a year.  The Plenaries
are three days long, with the first day and the morning of the
second day devoted to Working Group breakout sessions.  The remainder
of the time is divided between network status reports, Working Group
reports, and technical presentations.  Proceedings are produced for each
meeting, which include minutes of the plenary sessions, written
Working Group reports, and all presentation foils.  The Network
Information Center (NIC) at SRI has recently begun to act as a
distribution point for IETF Proceediings.
.PP
The last IETF meeting was in June at the US Naval Academy, where 13
working groups met and reported.  
In addition to this heavy Working Groups activity, there were presentations
on:
.IP
The organization and activities of the FRICC,
.IP
The early plans for how the Defense Research Internet (DRI)
will eventually replace the Arpanet,
.IP
Canadian research networking efforts; this report was given
by a representative from the Canadian National 
Research Council (their analog to the US NSF),
.IP
Self-synchronizing network behavior by Van Jacobson,
.IP
Cray's success at achieving 200 Mbps TCP throughput.
.PP
Another highlight was a thorough
report by Hans-Werner Braun of Merit, Inc. on the status of new NSFnet.
The report was so glowing that Hans-Werner volunteered to host the
October IETF at the University of Michigan to demonstrate the operations
of the new NSFnet firsthand.

Mailing Lists and Additional Information
.PP
There are two main IETF mailing lists: ietf-tf@venera.isi.edu and
ietf-interest@venera.isi.edu.  To join the interest list, send a
request directly to westine@isi.edu.  To join the main IETF list,
send a note to gross@ptt.lcs.mit.edu, with a brief statement explaining
your interest in the IETF.
.PP
It is worth noting that many of the Working Groups now have mailing
lists of their own.  For additional information on the IETF or any
of its Working Groups, drop a note to gross@ptt.lcs.mit.edu.
