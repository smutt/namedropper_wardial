I am not on the arpa-net so am unfamiliar with the way that it operates...
Am i correct in assuming that it is based soley on tcpip connections (which
should be relatively fast from what I know of tcpip - which is not a whole
lot - we have an ethernet here at univ of toronto with tcpip connecting the
various machines)

But the problem with multi-homed hosts as you called them seems to relate to
a similar problem that we have with the UUCP (unix) network. There are usually
at leat a half dozen paths from one site to another and the efficiency seems to
change all the time since paths are based on one site calling up other sites
and sometimes this can be as seldom as once a week or less.

There is usually an accepted route to most major sites but very often you can
find a better one without much difficulty. The problem is what the mailer
should do when it sees user@site and wants to figure out which intermediate
site to send it too.

What was said about using the path on the same network does not nessisarily
hold often because i have found that BITNET is the fastest network of all
that I have come in contact with (I believe it is faster than arpa). Therefore
i try to route much of my mail thru bitnet to a gateway closer to where I want
to go. The mailer on my system will not do this automatically since it doesnt
like to route things off-net to places on-net.

The way the new domainization is going, it is getting even harder to route mail
by hand. it seems to me that although sending it thru a gateway to site.domain
will be most effective and easiest for routing there is almost always a simpler
way (and faster). But now all the sites in the domain get hidden and you cant
see what connections they have to do routing with.

Enough rambling here :-) One problem I have had lately is with WISCVM.WISC.EDU
(the gateway from ARPA to BITNET). Is there any hope of getting another gateway
to relieve some of the load off of WISCVM? It always seems to eat my mail and
there are numerous complaints of too much traffic thru there. is there any
reason why there is only one gate?
