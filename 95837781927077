The recent flutter of messages concerning the need or lack thereof
for a set of MX records in domain BIT.NET or BITNET made me wonder
if people realize how MX records are being used.  The significance of
BIT.NET vs. BITNET seems unimportant.  The idea of providing domain
service for valid BITNET hosts seems worthwhile, even if only as
a transition.  But perhaps people don't realize that the UU.NET
domain service for UUCP simply fabricates an MX record for each
and every x.UU.NET query given it.  This results in all mail being
routed to one of the relays and processed or rejected there.  Some
might say this is a travesty, and although I don't necessarily agree
with that assessment, I think all should be aware how things are
currently working.

An incentive that could be provided for 'true' domain service
would be to point out that routing efficiencies can be achieved
if each BITNET site's MX response identifies the best relay
host.  Since this is host-specific information, a real registry
of all hosts would then have to be maintained in the mail
system.  Ditto for  UUCP, except that the selection of
a prefered relay is less geographical in nature due to multiple
trunk mechanisms for UUCP-land (UUNET).  In both UUNET and BITNET,
the selection of a prefered relay is relatively independent of
Internet topology, currently, so the same response could be
given to all requestors.

As the Internet  increases in complexity, it would probably be
worthwhile to include some additional information in MX responses
which the requestor could use in selecting from a menu of relay
possibilities.  For example, a host on NSFnet would probably prefer
to relay through a fellow NSFnet site if one were available, unless it
increased the cost for the UUNET or BITNET leg significantly.
So, indicators of 'location' both within Internet and on
the UUNET or BITNET side could be provided in MX response,
say two numbers between 1 and 9.  Even though I believe there will
eventually be one large Internet and no UUNET or BITNET, I think
that is a long way off and I think this coordinate system would
permit a large cost savings in the meanwhile.
