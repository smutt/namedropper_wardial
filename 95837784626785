&gt;     1)	Look for MX(foobar.foo.bar.edu). If I find it, everything's
&gt; 	just fine and I try to send to those hosts in turn.
&gt;     
&gt;     2)	Look for A(foobar.foo.bar.edu) and check that foobar has SMTP
&gt; 	as a WellKnownService ("strongly encouraged"). Found =&gt; OK.

    Right, except that almost nobody bothers with keeping their WKS
RR's up to date, so no one bothers to do WKS.  They just try SMTP if
they can find an A record.  (The Host Requirements RFC will make this
the officially recommended practice).

&gt; Now, what if I didn't get a usable answer (e.g. WKS didn't contain
&gt; SMTP) what do I do? Do I just have to give up, "host/domain unknown",
&gt; or is there more to do?

    Return the mail as undeliverable.

&gt; What I would like to do, but haven't seen in any RFC, is:
&gt; 
&gt;     3)	Look for MX(foo.bar.edu), MX(bar.edu) etc. until I get a
&gt; 	positive reply or reach the top domain (.edu).
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone please tell me:
&gt; 
&gt;     +	Is this completely wrong?
&gt; 
&gt;     +	If not, why is it bad approach (I guess it is since it isn't
&gt; 	mentioned in any RFC, although it's rather obvious).

    Well, the thought I had when writing RFC 974 was that it wasn't
clear you needed this practice.  The logic ran something like this:

    (1) If you have a host on the Internet, you have to list A and PTR
	records for it anyway, and some people believe you should
	list HINFO and WKS too.  Asking you to list MX as well is
	hardly a chore.

    (2) The only cases where I knew of people who wanted all mail for
	a domain like bar.edu, or *.mycountry delivered to one site
	were folks who were off net.  They could use the simple expedient
	of listing

	    *.bar.edu	IN	MX myrelay.xx.net
	    *.*.bar.edu	IN	MX myrelay.xx.net

	and all mail would be delivered to their favorite relay.

    (3) The third practice, of having all mail addresses to joe@bar.edu
	is also easy to handle.  Name your hub host bar.edu and fix
	every mailer in your campus to use addresses of the form
	joe@bar.edu.

&gt;     +	How should it be done instead? Does a name server have to
&gt; 	provide MX records for *every* possible mail address within
&gt; 	its domain (since "*" does not work if there exists a host
&gt; 	with the same name - a rather common scenario)?

    Well, yes.  I don't see what's wrong with that.  Many people generate
    their domain tables with programs these days -- what's wrong with
    listing an MX for each host?
