I have noticed a very strange problem with BIND when using $INCLUDE in
zone files.  In an effort to make management of the utexas.edu domain
easier, I would like to put each subdomain in its own file and $INCLUDE
it into the zone file for utexas.edu.  Note that this is different than
making each subdomain a separate zone and putting it a zone file.  I do
not want to do this.  Each subdomain file starts with a $ORIGIN line,
but no SOA record.

The problem occurs when BIND reads the utexas.edu zone file and starts
processing all those $INCLUDE files.  For every file it processes, it
syslog()'s a "No SOA record" error message.  The way I read the BIND
Operations Guide, $INCLUDE is just suppose to read the designated file
and process it as if it were part of the original file (BOG 4.8, Section
5.4.1), not start a new zone.  So if it is not starting a new zone, why
does it care about not seeing SOA records?  Something is definitely
wrong here.

After it gets done complaining, the server continues to work, but not
very well.  When I use nslookup to query the server, I get some strange
results.  For example, if I try to zone transfer xx.utexas.edu, where
xx is a subdomain but not a separate zone, I get a "Server failed"
error message rather than the expected "No information" message.  If I
edit the zone file and manually include all the subdomain files, thus
getting rid of the $INCLUDE directives, then everything works properly.
I get no "No SOA record" messages and zone transfers of xx.utexas.edu
return the expected "No information" message.

This confounds me greatly.  Either I'm interpreting BOG improperly, or
the action of $INCLUDE is inconsistent with its description in BOG.  I
would think that the two configurations I described would have identical
results, but obviously they don't.  I would appreciate some enlightenment.

This is all taking place under VMS 5.1-1 and MultiNet 2.1 (pre-release),
which includes a port of BIND 4.8.  BTW, the server I'm doing this on is
not one of the authoritative servers for utexas.edu.  It is a test
server I'm using to try various configurations of BIND to see which one
works the best and is easiest to manage.
