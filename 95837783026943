  I'm a little confused about some things having to do with CNAME records
and how they interact with other kinds of RR's. I know the official spiel
on "if you have a CNAME record for something, you can't have any other kind
of RR for that". That isn't where the confusion is. Here's what I want
to do, maybe someone can tell me how I can do it. The "official" name
for our main mail/news machine (the one that is in the HOSTS.TXT file and is 
the one name server queries for our domain are directed to; also the one that 
is output by hostname(1)) is not the same as the one that appears in mail and
news headers; for political reasons I cannot change any of the "official"
things. I changed the mail and news headers on purpose; the name I am
using there ("ncar", or "ncar.ucar.edu") reflects the name of our organization
and will be much more readily remembered by those who wish to send mail to
us than "handies" (the "official" name). There is a CNAME record in our
name server for ncar.ucar.edu -&gt; handies.ucar.edu. So far, so good. Everything
works fine. Now what I want to do is to have all incoming mail come in
through ncar.ucar.edu, so I output an MX record *.ucar.edu -&gt; handies.ucar.edu.
Then I discover the hard way that an MX wild card will not match anything for
which there is a valid A record (is that the way it is supposed to be, or
is there a bug in BIND 4.8?) So this still doesn't do it. Next, I add a series
of explicit MX records directing mail for all the ucar.edu hosts that have
A records to handies.ucar.edu. This all works great from the outside, but
now all mail from ncar to other ucar.edu hosts is broken, because the MX
record directs sendmail to handies, which it apparently does not recognize
as a reference to itself, and therefore fails with an "I refuse to talk to
myself" error. What I would really like is to convince sendmail that
handies == ncar. Apparently sendmail does not check for CNAME records,
nor does it check the name returned by an MX query against the Cw names
for itself (only the Dw name is checked). 
  There are two ways I can go that I can see; the first is to hack sendmail
to check MX records against all the Cw names instead of just the Dw name.
This is probably the correct thing to do, but I don't know enough about
the inner workings of sendmail to do this in any reasonable amount of time.
The other possibility is to just make handies a CNAME for ncar instead.
The trouble with that is that the name HANDIES appears in a number of places
besides MX and A records, such as in NS records and the SOA record. So, if
I change this around, is the fact that the name in the SOA record no longer
matches the name being output by the root servers going to hose things up,
even though the address is still correct? This is not something that I care
to find out the hard way. How about if I leave the SOA and NS records alone
and just reverse the A and CNAME records (make "ncar" the real name and
"handies" a CNAME for it)? Will the fact that the name in the SOA record
and NS records now points to a CNAME record now hose things up? Is
there a better way to accomplish my goal? Discussion welcome.
