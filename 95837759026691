Here is my own proposal for a relative naming scheme:

I'm at site xx.lcs.mit.edu and want to send mail to a user at
oz.ai.mit.edu.  There are two other possible hosts that may cause
problems here. The first is the host oz.ai, i.e. a host named oz in a
top-level domain named ai.  The second is the host oz.ai.lcs.mit.edu,
i.e. a host named oz in a subdomain named ai of the lcs subdomain.

Now CMU and others have offered the solution of using a trailing dot to
specify an absoute name; thus I would use "Joe@oz.ai" to send to
oz.ai.mit.edu and "Joe@oz.ai." to send to oz.ai.  However, this system
leads to no obvious solution for naming oz.ai.lcs.mit.edu.

I propose the following: No dot implies include your own domain.
Otherwise, use several dots to convey the rest of the name.  For each
dot, pluck off one more subdomain and append the rest.  Under this
system, the above addresses would be as follows:


xx.lcs.mit.edu	-&gt; oz.ai.lcs.mit.edu	= oz.ai
		-&gt; oz.ai.mit.edu	= oz.ai.
		-&gt; oz.ai.edu		= oz.ai..
		-&gt; oz.ai		= oz.ai...

If there were yet another subdomain between lcs and ai, e.g.
oz.ai.foo.lcs.mit.edu, it would be specified as oz.ai.foo, which is
quite straightforward.

The only drawback to this system is that hosts in completely different
top-level domains (such as oz.ai) require several trailing dots.  One
solution might be to adopt another character to signify an absolute
name, so that a host like seismo.css.gov could be specified as
"seismo.css.gov/", rather than "seismo.css.gov...".  To maintain
compatability with those systems that have adopted CMU's idea, the
meanings of the "." and "/" can be interchanged, so that the dot would
have the same meaning as at CMU.  Thus the above addresses would become:

xx.lcs.mit.edu	-&gt; oz.ai.lcs.mit.edu	= oz.ai
		-&gt; oz.ai.mit.edu	= oz.ai/
		-&gt; oz.ai.edu		= oz.ai//
		-&gt; oz.ai		= oz.ai.

Also note that from an implementation standpoint this system is wonderful,
since there is no ambiguity in an address.  That means only one name has
to be resolved, as opposed to the systems mentioned recently that require
trying several names according to a suffix list, until a match is found.
