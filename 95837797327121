karl&gt; I know that, periodically, people have a need to fake a top-level

All this reminds me of a strange thing I was wondering some time ago.
Now that we are connected to the Internet it is impossible to maintain
a system without running DNS (IMHO).  However - when you boot up bind
first thing it seems to need is to contact a ROOT name server.  When
none are found, bind becomes slow and unco-operative.

Some time ago the link from NordUNet to the Stated was down.  I was
really having trouble to get lut.fi running properly - its DNS didn't
know anything - even names it is authoritative for.  Well, one problem
was I had forwarders defined and my software (BIND 4.8 port to HP-UX)
has a nasty bug which ends up in an endless loop.  After I corrected
that I still had slow downs and name queries took time.  To correct
this I got an important piece of advice: add a ROOT name server which
can be reached.  I was suggested to add NIC.NORDU.NET to my root
cache.  And it helped.

After all this I was left wondering WHY AREN'T THERE ANY ROOT NAME
SERVERS IN EUROPE or Scandinavia?  When the links to the precious
servers in the States are down, life becomes (even more) complicated.
Having a ROOT server somewhere nearer would make me feel more secure.

Any good reasons?
