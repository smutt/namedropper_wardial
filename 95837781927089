	Subject: What is a mailbox?
	Cc: ganz@yale-ee-cesun2.arpa
	
	
	This is an attempt at sorting out what a "mailbox" as in mailbox binding means.
	I believe that a lot of the arguments I have seen over the last few weeks are
	due to the fact that different people talk about different things using the
	same terms without giving definitions. I have tried to define several
	constructs some of which we may later on agree that they can be combined.
	However, in order to identify all mechanisms mentioned in previous messages
	I would like to delay the process of combining constructs until we have some
	agreements as to what we mean.
	
	
	mail-accounts and their names
	
	In the following I am going from the assumption that mail messages originate
	from and end up at something called (for lack of a better word) a mail-account
	on a specific host. I make the following assumptions about mail-accounts:
	1) They have unique names among all the mail-accounts on a host
	2) They are the origin of mail messages
	3) They are the ultimate destination for mail messages
	4) They are owned by a person (we can be a little vague here with respect to
	   "logical persons", I hope)
	
	Note that the entity of interest here is the name of the mail-account, which
	may well be different from the "account name". This may among other reasons be
	because:
	1) Real account names may take forms that are not suitable for the rest of the
	   world to look at (e.g. 314159)
	2) Real account names may not be intended for the rest of the world to know
	   (e.g. we want to keep them secret)
	3) The system actually associates messages to something different than
	   accounts.
	I would expect that final delivery may involve some mapping. However, the use
	of a mail-account name will also allow us to be more narrow in our definition
	of how mail-account names must look.
	
	In a world in which hosts are uniquely named (e.g. using the current domain
	naming system), combining the names of mail-accounts with their respective
	host names will provide unique names for all mail-accounts.
	
	
	persons, person-references and person-addresses
	
	As has been pointed out by others, we would often like to send mail to a person
	by using the persons name and the (hopefully unique) name of an organization
	the person is or was associated with. I believe that in order to make such a
	method of identification useful we will have to let people be associated with
	multiple organizations, and we will have to support multiple names for people
	(e.g. multiple spellings of names, nicknames).
	
	In the following I will call (again for lack of a better name) such a unique
	identfication of a person a person-reference. I am making the following
	assumptions about person-references:
	1) They are unique among all person-references
	2) A real person may be known by more than one person-reference (e.g. a person-
	   reference where the person used to be; talking about stale information...)
	3) Each person-reference identifies either a person-address or another
	   person-reference (associated with the same person in most cases I would
	   presume)
	4) There may be chains of person-references. Each chain of person-references
	   identifies a person-address for which some mail-authority guarantees
	   delivery of mail messages
	
	In the above I have introduced the terms mail-authority and person-address,
	about which I make the following assumptions:
	1) A person-address may represent a logical entity (e.g. a mailing list) as
	   well as a real person
	2) mail-authorities have unique names
	3) A mail-authority controls the person-addresses associated with that
	   authority
	4) A mail-authority specifies the forwarding scheme for person-addresses under
	   its control (e.g. it will provide MX type information identifying a host
	   that will perform delivery)
	
	I have not fully thought through the mail-authority concept, but I think we
	do need something of that kind. Here are some other comments:
	1) A person-address would presumably identify a mail-account or a mailing list,
	   but this information may be private to the area of the mail-authority
	2) person-addresses may be replaced with person-references as people move
	   around from place to place. This suggests that a human user may not be
	   cognicant if what he uses is a person-reference or a person-address, and
	   we should therefore support interchangeable use of the two constructs
	3) while person-addresses are unique, forwarding schemes are probably the same
	   for large groups of them, I believe the system should reflect this
	
	
	mailing lists
	
	I am aware of several ways in which mailing lists are currently being used.
	Three examples are:
	1) There are lists of person-references which include references to people all
	   over the country as well as to other lists (e.g. namedroppers@sri-nic).
	2) There are lists of person-references which are mostly local within a
	   mail-authority (e.g. namedroppers-yale@cs.yale.edu).
	3) There are lists of mail-accounts which specify the preferred delivery for
	   people with multiple mail-accounts.
	
	These usages are very diverse and I am not sure yet if we should bring them all
	under one hat, but for the moment I will try to do so. Note that this will in
	particular require that mailing lists may contain both mail-account names and
	person-references. Here then are some assupmtions about mailing lists:
	1) All mailing lists are controlled by some mail-authority
	2) Mailing lists may contain person-references and mail-account names
	3) Mailing lists may be identified by person-addresses (Note that this means
	   that list expansions occur after forwarding of the message according to the
	   forwarding scheme mentioned earlier)
	4) Mailing lists will be placed with mail-authorities in a fashion that
	   attempts to minimize distribution traffic (i.e. to the extent possible
	   mailing lists will mainly contain entities for delivery within the
	   controlling mail-authority, I know that this doesn't help with the large
	   mailing lists like namedroppers, but I don't see what could be done there).
	
	Here are some comments about mailing lists:
	1) One of the critical issues associated with mailbox binding is where to do
	   expansion of lists. I currently think that if we support hierarchies of
	   lists and place the sublists at the proper places (e.g. all the Yale people
	   on namedroppers in a local sublist), expansion within the mail-authority
	   should be about as good as we can get without a tremendous amount of list
	   munging.
	2) If alternatively we would want to support message originator expanded lists,
	   person-references would also be permitted to identify mailing lists. I don't
	   think this would affect the rest of my definitions. Note BTW that
	   introduction of such lists in an evolutionary fashion would probably require
	   that list expansion by the message originator be voluntary.
	3) Leaving expansion of mailing lists with mail-authorities has the potential
	   of completely ignoring the definitions for them in the M? record context.
	   I am not advocating this.
	4) Mailing list expansion will require differentiation between mail-account
	   names and person-references. One of the questions to be asked is if
	   mail-account names should ever be known outside of the mail-authority in
	   which they are defined.
	
	
	The mapping into the M? record world
	
	The above definitions would need the recognition of at least one new construct,
	the mail-authority (if we consider the "organization" to be the same as the
	mail-authority). But more importantly, it would introduce information into the
	nameserver scheme of things that is restricted to access from within the
	mail-authority. True, the information could well be public, but one wouldn't
	want anybody from outside the area of the mail-authority to use it. I am not
	enthused about this since I don't like to introduce new concepts unless they
	are well justified. I see this clearly as a major subjet of discussion.
	
	Other than the new mail-authority, I think MR records would nicely represent
	person-references, and MG records entries in mailing lists. The major
	difference between RFC-883 and the above is the meaning of the MB record. It
	would need to represent three of information, some of which is accessible only
	from within the mail-authority. I would therefore see the following MB kind
	records:
	MB1 records represent person-addresses to the outside world. Their presence
	    promises deliverability, they refer to MB2 records.
	MB2 records are of an MX kind and provide the forwarding scheme.
	MB3 records represent person-addresses inside the mail-authority and contain
	    either a mail-account name or a reference to a mailing list.
	In addition I would expect that the ultimate place of delivery would contain
	mapping information to define the internal construct associated with the
	mail-account name (I view this as totally hidden inside the destination host).
	
	
	Epilogue
	
	The mailbox you ask? It could be a person-reference, a person-address or a
	mail-account name. If we make sure that all person-names are different from
	all person-addresses and from all mail-account names, we can even make it
	all of the above (which is really what has been going on quietly in some
	places for quite a while).
	
	I am sorry this got so long. I hope it will at least cause some reactions. AG
