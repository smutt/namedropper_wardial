   Perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and admit that there needs to
   be a more formal interface between the UK scheme and the rest of the
   Internet?

The problem that many USA and GB alike people seem to constantly forget
is that JANET and PSS ar *not* on the Internet in any sense of the
world. They are not part of the Internet, period. The fact that a Janet
address looks like an Internet address with the domains in reverse order
is entirely (well, almost) coincidental.

The fact that in the Internet the top level domain country code is GB
for the United Kingdom and CS for Czechoslovakia has no relevance
whatever for Janet and PSS, whose name spaces are administered by the
NRS according to rules that are not the Internet ones, even if there are
points of contact and similarities, that however engender a lot of
confusion.

When I see discussions by people quoting RFCs and wishing that
everybody conform to them, e.g. register in the DNS, etc..., they seem
to constantly forget that the Internet is *one* net, even if the
largest.

If the people on the Internet harbor the delusion that everybody must
respect the relevant RFCs, or else, they will lose connectivity with not
just the UUCP world, but also the UK, BITNET, and many others.

The next step in the evolution of the Internet is to recognize that
there are many Internets, and not only you want to link together many
networks running the same homogenous set of protocols and conventions,
but also heterogenous ones, e.g. at least:

	Internet
	UUCP
	BITNET
	Janet/PSS
	DECnet

On the other hand I wish that we all belonged to the Internet. I'd much
have preferred an XNS based, rather than a TCP/IP based, Internet, but
alas -- this is an impossible dream. What I sure do not want to see, and
I semm not to be alone as apparently many sites are migrating as quickly
away from it as they can, is an ISO/GOSIP based Internet taking shape --
things like Janet (i.e. its protocols) are a relic of the past. Still,
the practical point is that the Internet is most convenient, yet it is
not the only internet around.
