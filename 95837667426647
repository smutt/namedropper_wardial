Not all commonly used protocols can be documented by an RFC.

For example, "every" unix host can run uucp. I applied for a well known
host number for it. I can't write an rfc describing the protocol because
1) it's a real bitch and 2) it would probably violate AT&amp;Ts trade
secret restriction on the workings of the protocol. So, "everyone"
uses port 540 instead of a well known one.
(non-unix people can think of uucp as a spooled ftp. The current ftp
does not allow for spooling file transfers if the host is down. This is
a simplification of uucp, but reasonably accurate)

There exist many well known protocols that do not have detailed
documentation on the individual program. However, the code that
implements these protocols is widely available, so hosts have
no trouble using the protocol. 

I think that there is too much emphasis on a protocol being usable on
all machines. One should be able to have a well know port that is
operating specific. e.g. the Berkeley rlogin protocol duplicates
the functionality (in general) of telnet, but is much nicer to use
between unix machines.

I am concerned that the current practice of having an rfc describing
the protocol is severly hampering the use of well known ports. 
I know I don't have time to write an rfc describing uucp, but I
have code that is reliable and is in use all the time. Many of
these protocols are meaningless on non-unix machines (or
virtually impossible to implement). 

Since something like 60% of the internet machines are running Unix,
perhaps it's time to rethink the requirements for obtaining a well known
port. Otherwise, we might as well throw the idea away. Practice seems to
prove the current scheme doesn't work. Most unix machines use the
numbers in /etc/services as a defacto list of well  known ports, despite
what the official list might be.

A modification to allow the RFC to say something like "implements
the unix specific protocol uucp/rcp/rsh/rlogin/etc might be adequate".

On a slighly related note, given that Unix is becoming the dominant
OS on the internet, it seems that the "people" (a deliberately
nebulous term) involved in setting policy in general should have a
much better working knowledge of Unix than they do. It seems that
the TOPS20 people are strongly dominant in deciding the final form
of the various rfcs. This may be an artifact of the systems available
to them, but there have been several occasions when the lack of
unix familiarity has shown itself. (A recent example is the
"why would anyone use host number to host name mapping on a regular
basis" discussion. The Unix implementations use it a lot. Apparently
they are the only implementations that do).
