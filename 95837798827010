Jeff Makey's work with regard to validating domain-style names in the
UUCP Map sounds very interesting.

I would suggest that the best way to handle this info would be for
someone affiliated with the UUCP Map project to take the list of "bogus"
domain names and pursue the matter with the people submitting the map
entries involved.  Bogus domain names, in almost all cases, should
either get registered in the domain data base, or else they should be
removed from the UUCP Map.

For the past several months, we've been running a "pathalias"-based
program of mine here in the UCLA CS Department, which extracts all the
domain-style names from the UUCP Map, feeds them into "pathalias" with
"LOCAL" cost, and creates a path data base in which every path starts
with a domain-style name.  With only one or two sporadic exceptions, we
always succeed in finding such a path for every site in the UUCP Map.
I plan to release this program soon.

I've found it necessary to include an "exception list" for certain bogus
top-level domains that most likely will simply never go away, no matter
who complains or how loudly.  My current "exception list" includes:

		    .CDN, .JUNET, .JPN, .UUCP

Most of the above involve national networks which continue to use their
top-level domain names internally -- and the people responsible for the
UUCP Map entries involved have been unwilling to maintain two completely
separate sets of maps (one with the bogus domains, one without).  I'm
not 100% sure I can blame them; it's just as easy (though admittedly not
quite as elegant) to just use an exception list and ignore the domains
in question.

I also have the following temporary entries in my exception list:

	.CSNET     (one Japanese site still has a .CSNET name)

	.DUNET     (a couple of Danish sites use this domain)

	.K         (one Korean map entry had a typo; should
		    have been .KR)

I call these "temporary" because I've brought them to the attention of
the respective UUCP Map administrators -- all of whom have acknowledged
the problem and have promised to remove the bogus domains.  (But, at
least as of this morning, this hasn't happened yet.)

When I started this project several months ago, by the way, my exception
list was about twice as big as it is now.  By pointing out typos and
genuinely bogus domain names to various map maintainers, I managed to
whittle the list down this far.  Hopefully my "temporary" exceptions
will vanish soon as well -- though, likely as not, new one will arise to
take their place unless someone keeps monitoring the maps.

Of course, as Jeff pointed out, just because a domain-style name appears
in the UUCP Map underneath a valid top-level domain does not mean it's
automatically valid.  Lots of people simply give no thought to register-
ing a name in the domain data base.  I think many UUCP-only sites assume
that listing a domain name in the UUCP Map =is= registering the domain,
because they've never heard of the domain data base and/or (not being on
the Internet themselves) simply don't understand why they should need to
bother with anything other than the UUCP Map.

But the technique of simply assuming that domain-style names in the UUCP
Map are all valid (unless they are in obviously bogus top-level domains)
seems to work well enough for us.  It's certainly much better than sad-
dling our users with trying to understand the deeper mysteries :-} of
UUCP addressing (i.e., having users ask me, the resident mail guru, to
find a path for every UUCP address someone wants to use).

Whenever I do run across an invalid domain-style name in the UUCP Map, I
try to bring it to the attention of the relevant people at the site and
in charge of the map entry in question.  Sometimes this works, sometimes
I suspect I get ignored.  If someone official were doing this, by scan-
ning the entire UUCP Map automatically every month or so, I suspect we
could keep the domain data base and the UUCP Map in much better sync.
