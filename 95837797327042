	&gt; 	&gt; 	If you use UDP to make queries, you can't distinguish
	&gt;	&gt;	between:
	&gt; 	&gt; 		1) name server is dead
	&gt; 	&gt; 		2) query packet or response packet was lost
	&gt; 	&gt; 		3) name server is taking a long time to find
	&gt;	&gt;		   the answer
	&gt; 	&gt; 	
	&gt; Since cases 1 and 2 (above) are indeed problems, I will state again
	&gt; that VMTP would distinguish between 3 and the previous two.  So
	&gt; perhaps it is useful beyond the scope of recursive queries.
	
	Case 3 doesn't really happen (unless the server is seriously overloaded)
	with non-recursive queries since the name server has all the information
	needed for the answer already squirreled away.  I would be more

Quite right -- sorry, I'm asleep at the wheel here (or mouse, as the case
may be).

	concerned with the extra overhead associated with VMTP since timely
	responses will be received for the vast majority of non-recursive
	queries.

I don't think that VMTP is any more expensive than TCP (and probably
much cheaper, especially since it has a superior acknowledgement
mechanism).  Since it is in the kernel, it won't add much delay either.

Actually, in our configuration, we use recursive queries quite heavily,
since only our border-gateway (which is also a nameserver) can go off
net.  For us, it would be a big win to use VMTP for recursive queries.
