There's an implicit assumption here that .MIL is owned entirely by
the USA military, as opposed to, say, the Canadian military.  This
is not the way the other NIC domains are being handled, although in
practice it's how they are working out - very few organizations
outside the USA are interested in COM, EDU, GOV, ORG, or NET.

A name like A.MIL or ARMY.MIL doesn't say "US" in it anywhere, so
there's no way the British army could join the MIL domain.  In effect,
it's A.MIL.US.  This is OK, but I want to make sure we're all agreed
that this is the intent.  (In particular, I feel we should be sure that
the NIC, which owns the domain, agrees with this, if that's what we're
going to do.)

If/when the US military migrates to OSI (as I understand they are pushing
to do) they'll have to conform to X.400, which will in effect replace
their top level MIL domain with something under US.  What that something
will look like is anybody's guess, and it's a moving target, but it's
something to keep in mind while planning this.
