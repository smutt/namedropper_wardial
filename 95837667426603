I don't believe the so-called "foreigners' objections" are over whether
some of the current top-level domains such as EDU, COM, etc. are artificial,
but rather the absence of .US on top of these domains.  Given the history
of its development (development of the domain system), or rather its
evolution from the single domain .ARPA, its current appearance should
not be surprising.  Whether there should be a top-level domain .US
over EDU, COM, etc. is arguable.  I believe the "domain gurus" are
persuasible on this point.

Clearly, we need another level of domains between .US and individual
organizations.  As already pointed out, there are simply too many
organizations in the US.  Division by nature of the organization into
EDU, COM, GOV, etc. is one way of doing it.  I am not sure if it is
the best way.  But, on the other hand, is it that bad or "artificial",
a way for dividing the US domain?  Another alternative is geographical,
e.g., by state.  I can't see why by state is necessarily better than
by nature of the organization.  We will have more cross-state organizations
than multinationals.  A valid point for criticizing this division by
nature approach may be that if there are not many second-level domains,
some of them will remain too large to be managable.  In that sense,
it may be artificial.

Dave Alpern pointed out the issue of multinationals.  (Of course, he
is with IBM.)  That is an interesting issue.  It did come up when the
domain system was designed.  In the context beyond DoD Internet, I tend
to believe that the outcome would largely depend upon how the individual
multinationals prefer to register themself with the communication
authorities/administrators.  From a systems point of view, how do they
appear in the domain system may have an impact on system efficiency
and implementation.  However, there are other aspects such as the reality
of politics which easily override the system point-of-view.
