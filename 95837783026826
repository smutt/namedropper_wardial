   With the mail system I hope soon to install, I'd hoped to satisfy the
host table folks while not losing some of the benefits of the domain name
system.  Something you allude to worries me here, though; more on that
in a minute.

   I'd been planning on having all mail leaving the UMCP Computer Science
department (for example) appear to be From: user@cs.umd.edu.  I'd then have
MX records that look like:

	CS.UMD.EDU.	IN	MX	10 mimsy.umd.edu.
			IN	MX	20 brillig.umd.edu.
			IN	MX	30 tove.umd.edu.

or something like that, and then have a host table entry like:

	HOST: 128.8.128.8 : MIMSY.UMD.EDU,CS.UMD.EDU : ...

   In this case, most of the mail going to CSD would end up at mimsy.  I
suspect that is a substantial fraction, but by no means all, of the mail
coming into the UM campus, and mimsy is a 11/780-5, so I'm hoping that it
could deal with the load.

   (Aside:  it might be nice if people's mail delivery software would sort
MX records by precedence, and then use exchangers of equal precedence in
random order.  That way, I could even out the precedence above and actually
share the load, instead of just providing an illusion of load sharing that
only becomes real when, say, mimsy is down.)

   Your comment about having problems because Berkeley.EDU was an alias
disturbs me.  You mean that host-table users actually have problems because
of this?  Please tell me more...

   I'd also hoped to use the smail package and have my outgoing UUCP mail
appear with domain-based addresses.  That raises more backward-compatibility
issues than host tables vs. domain servers, but I want to try it just to see
how many hosts can't deal with the new addressing scheme.  (I'm also
providing a sendmail.cf hack so that people can send UUCP mail From:
mimsy!user if they wish, so that intermediate sites can do the same old
gross things to the headers if that's what it takes.)

   I guess it's obvious that my opinion is obviously more in the "damn the
torpedoes" camp.  If that turns out to have been the wrong thing to do, I
may back off from that position.  I'm hoping that it's not the wrong
approach.  I'm also hoping that everyone who converts to the new standards
will make converting a bit more attractive to those who might otherwise stay
mired in the past...and/or, at least, more attractive to the sales and
support people with whom they deal.

   Does anyone else have opinions to offer on my approach, or on the wisdom
of such an approach in general?

	-Steve
