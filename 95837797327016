&gt;Having at one time owned the ".GOV" domain (defacto, not dejure) I
&gt;would like to try and take a crack at this.
&gt;
&gt;The .GOV domain is supposed to be for US government organizations
&gt;(those with a "national" significance).  At the top of the .GOV tree
&gt;should be the cabinet level orgs such as Department of Justice,
&gt;Department of State, etc.  Before I left DCA, I had started the
&gt;actions to transfer policy level control of this domain to GSA.  The
&gt;person who is supposed to own this domain is Bill Ohle at GSA.  He (or
&gt;his office) should have final word on who exactly joins the .GOV
&gt;domain.
&gt;
&gt;I believe texas state government should be under the TX.US domain
&gt;because it isn't part of the "national" government.  I think the
&gt;hawaii.gov domain was probably the wrong way to go.

Whatever may have been done previously, the precedent for GOV to
encompass state government as well as federal government seems to
have not only been set, but is being enforced.

UUNET processes a *lot* of domain registrations for UUCP systems
(especially this month) and I've seen a few states get their own
domains in GOV.  In fact, I've yet to see a reasonable application
for GOV turned down.  Not only this, but we had a recent case where
the NIC *recommended* that a state government organization be put
in GOV.

We did have one case where an organization tried to get into GOV
under the classification of a branch of a county government.  The
organization was fairly unique in that in was a country organization
based in an educational institution.  They wound up in US, but they
had to register a large number of hosts in it.  I wouldn't worry
about the states, I'd start worrying about cities and counties.

I don't want to complain about the US domain since it certainly has
it's uses, but not being able to control your piece of a domain has
to be a royal pain.  The only time I ever recommend registering in
US is in the case of systems that aren't really owned by an
organization (ie: personal systems, public access sites, and the like)

Small organizations with one or very few systems may be able to get
by with US, but what about someone with a real network?
