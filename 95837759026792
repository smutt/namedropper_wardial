I was thinking of the Symbolics Namespace approach when I proposed the
SERV RR some months back on this list.  For a machine in the position
of a Lispm faced with the kinds of problems David was talking about,
you would do a single query {QNAME=host, QCLASS=*, QTYPE=SERV} and
pick your best option out of the result.

There are a couple of problems with WKS RRs.  One, which is the reason
that I am guilty of not having WKS RRs in the domain I administer, is
that early versions of bind fell on their faces if you tried to
include WKS RRs (actually, I think it was case-sensitive or some such
nonsense).  This has long since been fixed, but for non-technical
reasons I have been locked into running that old version of bind ever
since (believe me, you don't want the details, it'll probably change
soon).  I imagine there are other sites out there still with the
version of bind that quietly falls over and dies if you try to include
WKS RRs.

Another problem is that WKS RRs are hopelessly specific.  They are
really only useful for conveying information from the "Assigned
Numbers" RFCs.  While I think it is a good idea to list all major IP
protocols and give them all low numbered well-known ports, this does
not address (1) non-IP based protocols like Chaos, Decnet, etcetera,
or (2) experimental protocols outside the well-known-port range.

This has all been discussed before on this list.  This is why I
proposed an alternative RR format that was more general.  I haven't
gotten a response to either those messages or later private ones from
Jon Postel or Paul Mockapetris, so the idea hasn't gone any further.
Perhaps one of those two would care to comment now, since the subject
has come up again?
