You don't have to go all the way to the root (if you do, it's an
implementation problem, not a spec problem).  If your resolver already
knows (perhaps because you told it in an init file of some kind) where
the name server for bellcore.com is, your resolver is at liberty to
ask the right server the first time.

The CHIVES resolver system handles (well, addresses) the user-friendly
nickname problem you mention via search paths.  We use the syntax
suggested by Paul Mockapetris, several years ago: "foo" and "foo.bar"
will be expanded according to the search path rules, "foo.bar." will
not.  Obviously, we make sure that all hostnames that ever escape onto
the network (in mail messages, etc) have been canonicalized and are in
the standard syntax ("foo.bar").  The CHIVES user interface always
offers the canonical version of the target name as one of the return
values, so this isn't hard to do.

XX's resolver runs with a search path of 

	( .  LCS.MIT.EDU. AI.MIT.EDU. MIT.EDU. ARPA. )

Thus, "XX" means "XX.LCS.MIT.EDU", "TOTO" means "TOTO.AI.MIT.EDU" (not
"TOTO.LCS.MIT.EDU" because there is no such name and not
"TOTO.MIT.EDU" because AI.MIT.EDU is searched earlier),
"SCORE.STANFORD.EDU" means "SCORE.STANFORD.EDU", "SRI-NIC" means
"SRI-NIC.ARPA", and "ATHENA" means "ATHENA.MIT.EDU".  We could add an
entry for "EDU.", at which point "TOTO.MIT" would mean "TOTO.MIT.EDU";
"TOTO.AI" already means "TOTO.AI.MIT.EDU".

Two points are worth mentioning here.  First, the preceeding paragraph
presumably reads like a list of names of total strangers, except to
people familiar with the names of these MIT machines; the whole point
of the search path mechanism is to transform a name that is "obvious"
to our users into a name that is obvious to anybody.  Second, note
what happens if somebody adds "ATHENA.AI.MIT.EDU"; you have to be
careful about arranging the search path to minimize the chances of
somebody eclipsing a well-known nickname.  This is one of the reasons
for allowing the user to specify that a particular name should not be
expanded via the search path mechanism.

Who should set the search path and how widely it should apply (per
process? per user? per host? per site? per planet?) are decisions that
have to be made based on outside factors, such as the operating system
environment in question and user needs.  In general, the goal is to
have the abbreviation expand to the "obvious" fully-specified name;
the hard part is deciding what's obvious (cf. the story about the
philosophy professor in John Brunner's "Stand on Zanzibar").

For what it's worth, the search path code XX is running has been in
place for most of a year now, and the users apparently like it (voting
with their feet: a lot of MIT users who do not use XX directly send
mail through XX because they think the service is better).

The above is a simplified picture of how CHIVES's search path
mechanism actually works; I've left out a lot of implementation
details and performance hacks.
