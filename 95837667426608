John (and REM),

I'm not sure the European rules on connections across borders are
directly the question.  Maybe it will take name-server resolution to
discover what gateway is needed for a particular host, and maybe we'll
need a gateway in each building.  But I see no justification to force
a host to have two distinct names, one internal, based on organization,
and one external, based on country.  To a user all hosts within an
organization should (A) appear close, and (B) be obviously a member of
the same organization.  These are two aspects that we seem to have in
our current scheme, and which I would not like to lose.

It seems to me that we will end up having to register each organization
and provide a name-server in each country in which it has nodes.  The
problem to someone outside the organization will be in determining in
which country a particular host exists.  Internally, I expect local
aliases to do the trick.  Either that, or we will end up registering
ALL nodes in ANY country in which one of them exists, with proper
routing to a gateway.  Seems a silly waste of lots of storage, cache,
and communication.

It's not clear to me that this is a technical problem that needs to
be solved now rather than a political one that can settle down after
domains are long here and working.  I just wanted to make sure the
list (as a single conscious entity???) gives good thought to the
problems of using countries as top level domains.  Like all the
divisions we've come up with so far, some organizations just don't
fit perfectly to the scheme.
