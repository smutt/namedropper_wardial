We are using BIND to store MB records for mailbox names here at
UCSD - using a variant of NSLOOKUP to provide an on-line electronic
mail directory.

We have a mailbox name "u3g".  We also have a host whose nickname
of "u3g" is recorded as a CNAME entry under its real name.

BIND 4.8 reports this as illegal; I don't think it should be illegal
because of the difference between host-related information (A, WKS,
HINFO, etc) and mailbox-related information (MB, MG, etc).  
I suspect the same separation should exist for user-related data
(UID, GID, UINFO, etc).

It seems to me that we have at least three disjoint namespaces here
- host, mailbox, and user - and that the current version of BIND
does not properly separate them semantically when parsing the input file.

Clearly I can work around this in a way that the Athena people did
- by creating "mailbox.ucsd.edu" and "user.ucsd.edu" domains,
and storing the data under those - but that is just as clearly not
the right way to do it, since I shouldn't have to have separate
subdomains as well as types of RRs.

Since we have lots of personal workstations here, we're going to run
into this more often.  It seems quite reasonable to have a USER "wade",
a MAILBOX "wade", and a HOST "wade".  Yet these are clearly separate
entities, and grouping of data for them between the three namespaces
cannot be assumed.

Before I go hack on the BIND source to fix this, would someone
please let me know if I'm off-base, or whether this is really the
design error I think it is.
