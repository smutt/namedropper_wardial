We ought to separate the registration issues from the use issues.

It seems to me that if you own a network number, and if you can inject
packets into any of the well known areas of the internet, you should
be able to find somebody in that well known area who will support your
domain with their servers.  Remember that the servers don't have to be
related to your domain by name or anything else.  In any case, if you
can stick domain names in the database, you should be able to stick in
IN-ADDR.ARPA stuff as well.  There should not be anything different or
magical about IN-ADDR.ARPA.

Of course, this reduces the In-ADDR.ARPA problem to a harder one: who
should be able to own domains.  The removal of the connected status
rule also presumably means that a friend of mine who loathes computers
in general and likes to make gumbo could apply for GUMBO.COM and a
class C network if he chose.

To my knowledge, no RFC or domain draft, etc. makes any statement
about inverse mapping as an authentication tool.  I suspect that
inverse mapping requirements are viewed as an incentive to go the
trouble to create IN-ADDR.ARPA domains by folks who believe that its
helps to keep the database up to date, and if you can't set up an
IN-ADDR.ARPA domain, you are a shady character enyway.  The problem is
cases where the IN-ADDR.ARPA is missing for better reasons than
administrative sloth.

One case is the dynamic assignment scenario.  Another is the case
where domains are hidden from the outside world as a security measure.
These cases are growing in popularity and since there are no
standards, most are ad hoc and different.
