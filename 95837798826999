Jim --

In your recent message to the NAMEDROPPERS list, you made two sugges-
tions regarding the UUCP pseudo-domain:

(1) The address "paf@aleph.UUCP" can probably be changed into
    "paf%aleph@uunet.uu.net" for mail purposes.

(2) A top-level domain ".UUCP" ought to be created, with MX records
    pointing to "some convenient site such as UUNET".

My recollection is that UUNET stopped supporting Internet/UUCP mail
relay service some time ago -- except, of course, for those sites which
have paid the requisite $$$ to set up a direct UUCP link with UUNET.
(If I'm wrong, will someone from UUNET please correct me?)

The proposal for a ".UUCP" top-level domain has been raised many times,
but the "powers that be" in charge of the domain naming system are not
willing to accept it.  The main reason why not is that the domain hier-
archy isn't supposed to be based on network topologies, but rather on
organizational and/or geographical considerations.  Proposals for a top-
level domain ".BITNET" have been rejected for similar reasons.  Instead,
UUCP- and BITNET-only sites are being encouraged to register with regu-
lar domain-style names.  Unless you can come up with a highly novel and
compelling argument in favor of an official ".UUCP" domain, I'd advise
you not to waste the effort.

As for the UUCP site "aleph", the UUCP Map info suggests the following
"domain-style name first" path to get there:

		    unixprt!aleph!paf@mips.mips.com

Techniques do exist by which Internet-only (or almost Internet-only)
sites can process the UUCP Map info to produce a path aliasing map in
which each path starts with a domain-style name.  We have been using
such a system here in the UCLA CS Department for several months now.
Occasionally it fails -- usually because someone has listed a domain-
style name in the UUCP maps without bothering to register that name in
the Domain Data Base -- but most of the time it works just fine.
