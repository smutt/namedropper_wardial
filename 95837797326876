Jeff,
&gt; &gt;Note, however, that the very similar:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *.decnet.	in	mx 1	nic.the.net.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;would be illegal, because it makes "decnet" a top-level domain instead
&gt; &gt;of a sub-domain of utexas.edu.  That would probably get some people
&gt; &gt;rather annoyed at you.
&gt; 
&gt; I am doing this even as I type, and it works just fine.  I added the
&gt; following to my named.boot file:
&gt; 
&gt; 	primary		BITNET			bitnet.zone
&gt; 	primary		UUCP			uucp.zone
&gt; ...

	More precisely, YOUR mail works just fine.  However, if you want
to make sure that you don't screw up mail at other sites, you should
use:

 	primary		BITNET.your.domain	bitnet.zone
 	primary		UUCP.your.domain	uucp.zone

instead.

	Why does it matter?  By its nature, the domain name system is
distributed, and servers share information with each other.  You can
tell your server any bit of bogus information you want to if you can
guarantee that it will never pass it on to anyone else who doesn't want
it.  Assuming you are using BIND, about the only way you can make such a
guarantee (without rewriting large parts of named) is to disconnect your
machine from the network.

	But, you may protest, the information isn't bogus - it actually
does list real BITNET and UUCP gateways.  But what if other sites prefer
to use different gateways?  Or what if those gateways are replaced by
others, and you (or your successor) neglects to update your zone files?
What if BITNET and UUCP become real domains?  What if a whole bunch of
sites did what you've done, but not necessarily using identical zone
files?  The result of a lookup of a host in the BITNET or UUCP domains
will be essentially random, a prescription for chaos if I ever heard
one.  That's why the domain system delegates authority over a name to a
single responsible organization.

	Maybe your server will never break anything.  And probably if it
does nobody will be able to trace the problem back to your server.
However, there is a significant possibility that one day a year from
now, or two, or five, somebody thousands of miles away from you will not
be able to send BITNET mail because of your domain server.

	If you doubt my contentions, ask most any host that makes heavy
use of the domain name system for its list of root name servers.  The
list will almost always include several obsolete or completely bogus
entries (your mail gateway, NOSC.MIL, currently reports that it has
learned three obsolete root server names).
