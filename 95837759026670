A new version of the TOPS-20 name server has gone into production on
ISIB and ISIC, and will eventually be installed at the NIC once its
reliability is proven.  The new server collects statistics, and the
statistics reveal several real problems with the way clients are using
the servers which will result in incorrect answers and/or degraded
performance.  The following observations were made over the last few
days, and are based on over 100K queries; the combined query rate for
the ISIB and ISIC name servers is approaching 1/sec, although there is
good reason to suspect that a lot of the traffic is needless.

77% of all queries are for type A information, 79% of all queries
specify QCLASS=*, 71% of all answers have "name error" set, and only
15% of all answers have "authoritative" set.

	This suggests that a lot of resolvers are asking for address
	information with QCLASS=* and interpreting a non-authoritative
	"name error" response as temporary, and trying again later.
	Note that the non-authoritative response is a reasonable action
	on the server's part for any error condition which the server
	can't guarantee for all classes.

	Suggested solution is to use QCLASS=IN in these queries, which
	will allow an authoritative response by the server.

6% of all queries are for MAILA.

	MD, MF, and MAILA are obsolete and have been replaced by MX.
	See RFC 973 and 974 for details.  The new root name server
	translates MD and MF RRs in the NIC database into MX RRs,
	so MD, MF, and MAILA queries don't return anything.  I apologize
	for the delay in getting MX up on the root servers, but MD, MF,
	and MAILA are doomed.

	Solution is to use MX.

12% of all answers had delegation

	The root name server is handing out delegations with zero TTLs.
	The database needs adjustment.  (ROOT server database problem)

On a happier note, it appears that the domain system is getting wide
use.  Both ISIB and ISIC are getting requests from more than 100 clients
in the course of a day, and the total load on these servers seems
constant, even when one machine is down, suggesting that clients switch
over when one fails.
