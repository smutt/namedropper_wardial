yep.

i don't know.  could be.  routers are pretty cheap though.

it's not clear to me how this is a problem.  i was under the impression
that the primary for the domain is the authoritative source for name service
for users outside the domain.

[the answer is procedures for interacting with the central authority]

sure, if that works.  my point is it doesn't always and i don't know of
any good reason why the database should centralized.  after all doesn't
the above argument apply to the nic? a few more dollars and the nic
could manage everything, hmmm in fact we could have just this one file
with everyone in it and copy it out to all the hosts that want to do
lookups.

bzzzzt. at lots of unpleasantly political institutions it is a question of
power.  e.g. in another life the people who owned the routers claimed they
couldn't pass traffic unless everyone was in their domain.  control freaks
are alive and well and living on a network near you.
