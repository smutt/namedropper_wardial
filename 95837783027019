In the recent past there has been some talk about which IP address to use
when the resolver returns more than 1 for a destination address. For the most
part the problem has been past off as no problem. In most cases hosts have
only address and are connected to only 1 network using this address.
In this case, there is no problem of which address to use since there is no
choice.  However, I believe that if the resolver
returns more than 1 address for any given host the order can make a very
big difference in network throughput. In this note I will describe the
problem and then a solution that I am currently propagating throughout
our machines.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY:
   There are 2 networks of concern, a Hyperchannel and an Ethernet. 
There are a few gateways that connect up the networks together.
There are some hosts that are only connected to hyperchannel, many only
connected to ethernet, and many hosts which are connected to both networks.
It is preferred that hosts talk over hyperchannel when possible. Thus, if
two communicating hosts have both ethernet and hyperchannel connections,
it would be preferred that hyperchannel be used.

PROBLEM:
   If we list all hosts in the named database with the hyperchannel address
always preceding the ethernet address ( we are assuming that we are trying
to give hyperchannel higher priority over ethernet) when a host does a 
gethostbyname call hyperchannel will be returned as the first address in
the address list. Programs like ping, telnet and ftp take this list and
try to connect to the addresses in the order gethostbyname returns them in,
thus, hyperchannel would be tried first. This works okay if both hosts are
on hyperchannel. If the originating host is on ethernet only and the destination
host is on both ethernet and hyperchannel this method would cause the
originating host to use a gateway to get to the destination host. This is
obviously not what we want to do. This condition is a very serious drawback
on the resolver; causing extra network load, slower throughput rates, and
conceivably overloaded gateways.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS (bad):
   A possible solution to the problem is to have multiple servers for the 
domain where one server lists hyperchannel addresses first and the other 
server lists the ethernet addresses first. Then make all hosts on ethernet
only point to the name server that lists ethernet addresses first, and do 
the same sort of thing for hosts on hyperchannel. This scheme breaks
down though, when you add in a proteon network and with its
priority. Also, the solution is
harder to administer and is bad in the face of downed servers. 

Another solution is to force users to specify which network they want by
doing the following:
		hosta		IN	hinfo	"no address listed"
		hosta-ec	IN	A	ethernet
		hosta-hy	IN	A	hyperchannel

If the user wants to get to hosta they would have to specify by which network
they would like to go. This is bad because it is not user friendly, requires
the user to have more knowledge of the network, and is not as robust in the
case of network outages.

GOOD SOLUTION:
   This solution introduces 2 new settings that can be set from the 
configuration file. The options names are: 
		subnet		&lt;ip netmask&gt;
		network		&lt;ip address&gt;

The network option allows you to prioritize the addresses based on the network
they belong to. You can list MAXNETS (#define to be added to .h) network
options in the order of precedence. Thus, if the resolv.conf file looked like:

	..	
	..
	network	192.12.102.0
	network 128.102.0.0
	..
	..

the gethostbyname call would return all addresses from the 192.12.102 network
first followed by any addresses from the 128.102 network, then any remaining
addresses. 

For example: host = 128.111.48.1, 128.102.16.1, 192.12.102.1  gethostbyname
	would return the addresses in the following order: 192.12.102.1,
	128.102.16.1,128.111.48.1


If there are no network statements in the conf file then the gethostbyname will
work as it currently does now. 

The subnet options allows you to specify a mask to apply to the network
options. Thus, if the resolv.conf file contained the following lines:

	subnet 255.255.240.0
	network 192.12.102.0
	network 128.102.16.0
	network 128.102.0.0

and host = 192.12.102.1,128.111.48.1,128.102.16.1,128.102.192.1
    gethostbyname would return the addresses in the following order:
	   192.12.102.1,128.102.16.1,128.102.192.1,128.111.48.1

It should be noted that in this example that 128.102.16.1 is returned before
128.102.192.1 regardless of how listed in the database because the 128.102.16
subnet has higher precedence than the rest of the 128.102 network.


CONCLUSION:

  I have tested this solution and it does work with no noticeable performance
loss. As we put the resolver on our crays this will prove to save our gateways
from quite a bit of unnecessary traffic. If anybody has any comments about
the proposed solution then please do not hesitate to write.
