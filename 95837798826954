This is a joint statement from the administrators of the domain .de and 
the staff of the German EUnet-Backbone at the University of Dortmund.
  It is meant to clarify the situation concerning the Topleveldomain .de 
which has been widely discussed in this newsgroup under different topics.

 1	The administrators of the "de" TLD are not to be confused
       	with the EUnet backbone "unido":
       	  The domain "de" is administered under authority of all existing
       	networks in Germany: CSnet, DFN (X.400), EARN, EUnet (in alpha-
       	betical order). The persons in charge are fulltime staff of the
       	University of Dortmund.
       	  The EUnet service is provided by University of Dortmund in 
       	cooperation with the German Unix systems User Group (GUUG).
       	EUnet staff mainly consists of a group of dedicated students 
       	on part time contracts with the university.

 2	There are a few conditions for registration under .de which 
       	have been agreed upon by ALL networks operating in Germany.
       	  This refers to the name of the subdomain and the restriction
       	that subdomains of "de" are given to institutions (as opposed to
       	individuals) only.

 3	A few people and/or organisations do not adhere to these rules,
       	and chose to register under other domains than "de".

 4	Due to the involvements of more than one networking organisation
       	and the associated administrative overhead initially some problems
       	had to be cleared up. This has been done now.
