pcg&gt; The fact that in the Internet the top level domain country code is GB
pcg&gt; for the United Kingdom 

enag&gt; It's also my understanding that it was the then administrators of
enag&gt; NRS or whatever who decided to implement their own hack with
enag&gt; respect to domain names, and ignore ISO 3166.

Which they are perfectly entitled to, because Janet and the NRS are
totally independent of the DNS and Internet. The use of ISO 3166 is an
Internet convention; other networks can use other conventions.

pcg&gt; When I see discussions by people quoting RFCs and wishing that
pcg&gt; everybody conform to them, e.g. register in the DNS, etc..., they seem
pcg&gt; to constantly forget that the Internet is *one* net, even if the
pcg&gt; largest.

enag&gt; If you want to talk to or with the Internet, follow Internet rules.
enag&gt; It's as simple as that.

Say that to the X.400 people. They sure will listen. :-) :-).

enag&gt; If you continue to insist that you should be allowed to follow
enag&gt; whatever rules you fancy on the Internet, you will have to be
enag&gt; taken off the net, either by force from the Internet side, or by
enag&gt; default, since you won't be reachable.

That's not the problem, the problem is whether the Internet has ways to
address of issue of communicating with networks that do not follow
Internet rules. As far as I am aware, the % hack is the only half baked
way, and all its critics clamor instead for its removal and everybody
registering with the DNS, and having MXs point at the relevant gateways.
This is clearly *impossible*. It will never happen, not even within the
USA. It is not even desirable.

But a lot of people in this newgroup forget about that, as I have
already remarked. They complain about Janet/NRS names not complying to
RFC syntax. Well, precisely -- they have nothing to do with Internet
syntax, they belong to a different world, like the UUCP ones (to which
exactly the same ideas apply).

This is forgotten by all the Internetcentrics that for example think
that everything that has dots in it must be an Internet name, and would
therefore do rabid name resolution based on that delusion. The % hack is
not an hack to do source routing; it is a way to say @ in a non Internet
sense within an Internet address. If we had a network out there where
the dot had a special meaning, we would need a dot synonym as well
probably.

Should a gateway rewrite any addresses in NRS format to DNS format? even
if in signatures? Even if they make no sense in the DNS? I think not,
IMNHO, because in general it is not *possible*, because ther emay be no
equivalent.

Even in the easiear cases, it may be better not to provide translations
between two different naming syntaxes/conventions.

Suppose that I send a message to the Internet from Janet; I should
address it (and I do) as

	enag%slembe.ifi.uio.no@uk.ac.nsfnet-relay

because I must address the gateway using NRS conventions (and this
explains what is at the right of the @), and I cannot use the DNS
address the target while using the @ contained in it because that has
meaning for the NRS.  Almost by chance the Janet-Internet gateway uses
the percent hack to resolve the overloading of @, but it could decide to
accept e.g. '#' as a synonym for the DNS @, or provide some form of
quoting (which would be best, or my idea to use a Then-To: header for
gateway use).

When I get a reply from the Internet, it might/should be addressed as
(assuming that the Internet side of the gateway uses % as a synonym for
@ as well):

	pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.Janet.net
	pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.NRS.org
	pcg%uk.ac.aber.cs@nsfnet-rely.ac.gb

(which one do you think would be most appropriate, incidentally?) but
not as

	pcg@cs.aber.ac.uk

which is not a legal Internet address (ironically it may be currently
valid though, because of the double registration of Janet names in the
NRS and the DNS, if I remember correctly).

Of course there is no reason to assume that I need type all this myself;
the MTA could apply heuristics (which break down in the CS case for
example, but that is not a problem with naming schemes, only with the
heuristics) and detect when the supplied address is outside the locally
valid naming zone and generate the reference to the appropriate gateway
in the apporpriate form, e.g. using tables, as we seem condemned to do,
both Janet and Internet, when addressing somebody in the X.400 world.

pcg&gt; If the people on the Internet harbor the delusion that everybody
pcg&gt; must respect the relevant RFCs, or else, they will lose
pcg&gt; connectivity with not just the UUCP world, but also the UK, BITNET,
pcg&gt; and many others.

	[ ... avoiding ... ]
enag&gt; This is largely achieved by having gateways that accept and follow the
enag&gt; rules of both the networks they're on.  You seem to think that the
enag&gt; Internet should accept all sorts of standards, and have failed to
enag&gt; grasp the idea of a gateway.  This is not the Internet's fault,
enag&gt; either.

I think you have failed to understand the context of this discussion at
all, which was why the % hack is necessary. Let me repeat here in yet
another form: it is necessary to hide @'s that have meaning in non
Internet naming zone addresses from over eager Internet resolvers, and
thus avoid breakdowns in the heuristics used to convert addresses
between two different conventions.

Were it true that gateways were properly designed! And were it true that
gateways *could* be properly designed, that they could convert all
addresses meaningfully.


On a fairly different subject:

enag&gt; This doesn't scan well.  Are you saying that many sites are migrating
enag&gt; as quickly away from ISO/GOSIP networks as they can?

Oh yes.

enag&gt; I wasn't aware of any ISO/GOSIP networks that any site could
enag&gt; migrate away from to begin with,

Well, in continental Europe the *only* WANs available are ISO oriented
(and eventually GOSIP oriented). What is happening that the level of
service is crude enough and expensive enough that many sites are running
a largish segment of the Internet in Europe using these WANs as
transport, with TCP/IP tunnelling on X.25 (or ISDN when available, or
even on point-to-point lines, even switched ones, where not available).

Norway is different because it was on the ARPAnet since SATNET days.

enag&gt; and it seems to me that this ISO/GOSIP stuff is being migrated
enag&gt; _to_ by people who want to win contracts with the GOSIP folks.

That is something that is happening with the *government*. Where people
have to pay with their own funds, the move away from ISO and to TCP/IP
is obvious to the naked eye. In Europe it is slowest in the UK, where
Janet is (nearly) 100% government subsidized, and for some EEC projects,
where the same idea applies.

enag&gt; I know I would be very happy to be wrong, but the trade rags haven't
enag&gt; made me feel that way for a long time.

No, no. You can be happy, try to figure out the number of names in the
Internet that have a .de .dk .nl .fr .se .fi top domain and their
increase in the last few years. De facto, the Internet is today the
dominant international WAN in continental Europe, at least as far as the
research community is concerned.

enag&gt; Give me three years, and you'll have Internet
enag&gt; all over the United Kingdom.  Any takers?  :-)

If only...

I think it could be done in three months. I reckon virtually all Janet
sites actually run Internet protocols locally, and by buying
off-the-shelf switching equipment and reusing the current lines a switch
to TCP/IP interconnection among them could be done fairly quickly.
