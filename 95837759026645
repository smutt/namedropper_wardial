Mary --

Replying to your message:

	We have made a few minor changes to the online domain
	registration template in NETINFO:DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT.
	In keeping with our policy to limit the number of domain
	and host nicknames, the new template asks that you specify
	no more than one domain nickname.  Also, a procedure for
	making changes to existing MILNET and ARPANET host names
	is given.  Please use this template for any future domain
	registration applications.

I seriously question whether it is advisable to limit the number of
domain nicknames for a host.

One good example of a case where multiple domain nicknames are desirable
is UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU (10.2.0.78).  So many people have it "hard-wired"
:-} into their heads that this host name is "Berkeley" that to forbid
them to list BERKELEY.ARPA as a nickname in the host table (in addition
to UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU and UCB-VAX.ARPA) would have resulted in a severe
disruption of mail service.  Other examples exist as well.

Also, a policy of this type may complicate efforts by an organization
to list their second-level domain name as a synonym for one of their
third-level domain names (e.g., BERKELEY.EDU as a nickname for
UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU).

As long as nicknames are permitted (via CNAME RR's) in the domain data
base -- and as long as there is still a need to support the NIC host
name table -- I do not see anything to be gained by a policy that for-
bids the listing of a name in the data base but not in the NIC table.

If a NIC table "space crunch" is in evidence, may I suggest that the
logical place to impose limits is in the area of NON-domain nicknames.
Since the non-domain nicknames are not (and, as far as I am aware, never
will be) listed in the domain data base, keeping these names in the NIC
table -- and permitting the listing of new non-domain names -- will
simply complicate efforts to phase out the NIC table in favor of the
data base.

I would therefore suggest that hosts be allowed to list a reasonable
number of domain-style nicknames -- but that NO more non-domain-style
nicknames be accepted for inclusion in the NIC table, and that a time-
table be set up for elimination of the existing non-domain nicknames.
