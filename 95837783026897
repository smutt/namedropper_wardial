   Possibly to force certain traffic to be put on certain nets. If its known
   that heavy traffic comes from 2 sites who can be directed to use different
   networks based on the IP address returned by a RR query, it may be
   advisable to try and force the sites to use a particular network to avoid
   heavy usuage on 1 network. Thus by not allowing random selection
   heavy congesting. 

I don't think the name server is the appropriate place for this sort
of functionality.  Routing belongs to gateways.  Admittedly, the
routing paradigms for multi-homed hosts are somewhat broken.  Routing
by name inference is also broken.  One cannot rely on a particular
order of responses.  One might (big might here) desire to make certain
interfaces preferred.  In bind, this is currently done with the
sortlist option in the boot file for all names.  One might desire
a way of specifying for each individual host.
   
   As an aside:
     At NASA this forced routing is done for traffic on hyperchannel. After
   some tests that I performed this week I noticed that by forcing certain
   traffic to take particular routes I was able to maximize performace
   while limiting collisions (or contention) on the network. When the mapping
   wasn't done overall performace went down for all connections (or at least
   a good deal of them).

As an additional aside:
Not quite.
At NASA (ARC NAS program for those of you curious which part of NASA)
this 'forced routing' is done at the IF layer, as the multiple
interfaces are currently all on the same network.  The name server
doesn't get involved at all.  In fact, the only programs here that
currently even call the name server are some of the mailers.

The forced routing you did was choosing a different gateway, which
the nameserver didn't get involved in at all.
