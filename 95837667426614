I am relatively new to the name server stuff, so my questions may
be obvious, and the terminology may be incorrect, but who else could I ask?
I also realize that although we have had a domain name server in place
for quite some time, my corner of the internet is late in actually trying
to use it.

I am trying to install name servers on the Purdue Engineering Computer
Network machines.  These are primary 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD machines, so
some of my questions may be relevant to that specific implemenation,
but most are general in nature.  Currently, the purdue network situation
looks like this:

	128.10		192.5.40		  128.46 (with ~8 subnets)
	192.5.48	192.5.101
			192.5.102
      -------------   ---------------                ---------------------
      |           |   |             |                |                   |
IMP---| CS Dept. pucc-i     PUCC    pucc-j--------ecn-ed   ECN+others    |
      |           |   |             | |              |                   |
      ------------    --------------- |              ---------------------
         |                            |
        IMP                          IMP

ECN is my area of interest.  Currently, we have about 30 machines with
a combined user base of about 10,000.  Reliability of network
services is a primary concern.  Currently, an authoratative
nameserver exists in the CS Dept on a host called PENDRAGON.
I am working on networking for the ECN group of machines
on the right.  The current problem is that PUCC has very restricted
operating hours, and we are "cut off" from the rest of the world
for large fractions of the week.

In setting up the nameserver stuff, I have to plan for extended times
when our primary domain authority is unreachable.  My questions are:
Is this really a problem?  If it is, should I then plan on redundant (2)
authoritative nameservers within ECN?  Should they also be authorative
for our sister domain "rice.edu"?

Also, with the latest berkeley name daemon stuff, I noticed that they
initialized the whole berkeley name space from a file on all machines.
Is this an attempt to be operational even if the authorative name
daemon is unreachable, or is this just an efficiency optimization?

Also, I guess I should set up some authoratative nameservers for
"46.128.in-addr.arpa" (and maybe purdue.edu).  Who do I contact
to register such authority?  Also, how easy is it to change
authoratative servers?  Would it possible to test the domain stuff
on little used machines and move the authority to production machines
later, or should I start out with the most obvious production choices?

I realize that there are a lot of questions asked in this letter.
Really what I am asking is: given my situation, how should I proceed
in order to:
1) guarantee reliable name service for both local and remote hosts.
2) fit in well with the internet domain naming system.
Suggestions are appreciated.
