	Network Management Tool Descriptions Wanted

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now requesting entries
for a catalog of tools for managing TCP/IP internets.  The catalog
will be a compendium of the tools available to assist network managers
in debugging and maintaining their networks.  Network management tools
and LAN management tools (other than breakout boxes) will included.
The IETF intends to publish the catalog as an RFC.

Entries describing public domain, copyrighted, and commercial tools
are solicited.  Vendors are encouraged to submit descriptions of their
products.  Descriptions from knowledgeable users of commercial and
noncommercial tools are also welcome.

Tool descriptions should be objective, no more than two or three pages
long, and should contain the following sections (where applicable):

NAME
     Whatever.  For those naming tools, be aware that there are already
     many variants of "network monitor."

KEYWORDS
     For now, a best guess.  A uniform key-word list is under development.

ABSTRACT
     A brief description of the tool's purpose and characteristics.

MECHANISM
     How the tool works.

CAVEATS
     Warnings about tool impact on system performance, etc.

BUGS
     Most likely "none known."

LIMITATIONS
     Number of nodes that can be monitored, privilege required to operate,
     etc.

HARDWARE REQUIRED
     What hardware does the tool run on, and what extra hardware is
     is needed, if any.

SOFTWARE REQUIRED
     What OS does the tool run under, and what extra software is needed,
     if any.

RELATED ANALYSIS/POST PROCESSING TOOLS
     reduction tools, graphics support, etc.

AVAILABILITY
     How to obtain the tool, and whether it is in the public domain,
     copyrighted, or commercially available.  This will not include pricing
     information.

The format for the entries is as above: section headings capitalized and
left-justified, with section text indented five spaces.

An IETF review panel will edit all catalog entries.  Though
contributors will be given final authority to approve or disapprove
revisions to their submissions, the IETF reserves the right to exclude
entries that do not meet its editorial criteria.  Editing of the
catalog will be completed this November.

The deadline for tool descriptions for the first edition of the
catalog is 1 October 89.

Send tool descriptions or requests for further information to:
