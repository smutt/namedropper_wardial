The problem of multi-homed hosts gets expanded when you consider
one group of hosts as one host and consider multi-homing them
(CYPRESS, ARPA, NSFnet, BITNET, UUCP), as we have here at BU.

The problem grows in magnitude. Consider: If some of your hosts
are routed through one gateway and others routed through another.

Also, consider where some hosts are reachable from the group of hosts
through more than one interface/gateway (e.g. Rutgers is on ARPA and
NSFNet, if we are also then we need to know that the NSFNet is faster
for connections to NSFNET hosts and ARPA is faster than CYPRESS-NET
for others. And note: I am just talking about the TCP/IP stuff now,
trying to deal with BITNET and UUCP may tip the scales too heavily.

Unix has a way of dealing with this but it is incomplete. Their
"/etc/route add" command let's us define a Rutgers-net and how to
reach it, but that is just like maintaining a host table since	 you
have to know each and every route you are going to use.

"/etc/route add" has a "default" entry, but that's not what you really
want here, since for example in the ARPA case, you can't use the
ARPA backbone for non DOD Research, and if we as an entity want to
have connectivity with commercial entities, and those companies
want to advertize to us, we can't let that get out over the ARPANET.

Maintaining individual routes is fine for now, there are usually few
gateways (not routes, I mean gateways) that you really want to reach,
but as the Internet expands and grows, this information really needs to
be decentralized, either in the domain system or in some other system.
