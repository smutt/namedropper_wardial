Thanks for the reply, Jon.
A few notes..

&gt; I'd suggest that you set up a name server inside the ECN world that is
&gt; authoratative for all of Purdue, but not for any place else (e.g.,
&gt; Rice).
That is what I am working on now.

&gt; I don't know about the Berkeley stuff of initializing all 
&gt; hosts from a local file.  Somehow it sounds like a bad idea.
I was confused about Berkeley.  I was looking at one of their authoratative
servers, and I thought otherwise.  They are doing things right.

&gt; As far as setting up a "46.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA" domain, i don't know if it is
&gt; really necessary, and i don't think the NIC is prepared to delegate
&gt; part of the IN-ADDR tree yet.  How often is there a request for
&gt; IN-ADDR information?
I see a relatively large need for the 46.128.in-addr.arpa domain.
All authentication of remote login, remote shell, etc. under UNIX is done
by looking at the source address on the socket, then mapping it to the
name.  When the NIC is unreachable, we would not be able to do authentication.
For us, the NIC is unreachable for large time blocks when our gateways go down.
Hopefully, the NIC will be able to delegate this stuff soon.
In the long run, I would think that they would want to do so.

&gt; It should be fairly easy to change authorative
&gt; servers but i don't think one would want to do it more than once a
&gt; week.
I think I have a relatively stable situation planned from the start.
	
Thanks again for the tips and thanks also to Kevin Dunlap for helping
to clear up my confusion.
