Hi folks.  Sometime today (02-Jan-90), we will be replacing the machine
ns.nasa.gov (128.102.16.10), which is currently a SUN 3/60S running
a very hacked up 3.5 SunOS with a new SparcStation I, running a slightly
hacked 4.0.3c.  The new machine will have the same address as the old
machine, and the same configuration for being a root nameserver.  This means
that you folks don't need to change your named.ca files.

One reason this cutover is occuring is that the SS1 is capable of supporting
more than 1 ethernet interface.  In fact, a 2nd ethernet controller in the
SS1 will be connected to the FRICC Inter-agency interconnect network at Ames,
at address 192.52.195.10.  Thus, you will be able to reach the new server
at both 192.52.195.10 and 128.102.16.10.  Remote users (that is, everyone
outside of Ames) will be better served by the new address, which is one
router closer to wherever you are.  You will no longer need to route to
the Ames network get service from this machine.

In addition, this machine also has a radio clock attached and runs xntpd
to provide NTP time services.

I'll send out a note after the cutover is complete.  I do not expect
the change to take long, as the SS1 is already running in a cloned 
nameserver configuration on another address.  The root server update
software has been checked out as well, so it takes is to remove the
old machine, and change the configured addresses, and then reboot.

Don't worry about the 3/60S though, he'll be upgraded to 4.0.3 and 
take over local nameserver services for Ames and serving as a secondary
for a number of associate's domains (BIND doesn't work when you ask it
to be a root nameserver and a secondary for some domains).

Bugs and gripes (compliments reluctantly accepted too :-)) to me.

					Thanks,
					    Milo
