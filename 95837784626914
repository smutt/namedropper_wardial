&gt; I don't think this is DEC's mistake, but rather a French mistake -- "if it
&gt; ain't &lt;mumble&gt;.FR, it ain't in France" or so they say.  I'll acknowledge that
&gt; just about every country outside the US has made this mistake too, but it
&gt; doesn't alter the fact that it's a mistake.

It may be a mistake, but its really not parochialism that has caused it,
but pragmatism - its the only way to stay within the rules and be part
of the domain system at the same time.

To get a registered .edu, .com, or whatever domain, it is required that
there be some internet site prepared to act as a mail forwarded - if you
happen to be in the US, and probably Canada, or perhaps if you just happen
to know the right people, that is something that may be manageable (though
even there its not necessarily easy).  If you're outside north America,
and have no contacts there, its basically impossible.

Its much easier to arrange blanket forwarding for a top level country
domain, and then take care of internal routing and domain management
locally - that way there only needs to be one person in the country with
the right US contacts, its also much easier at the US end - there is just
one very stable nameserver entry to look after.

While I agree that the requirement for a mail forwarder is probably
useful, in hindsight it was also probably a mistake.  After all, there
is no requirement for an FTP forwarder, or a TELNET forwarder .. it is
recognised that there are simply some places that can't be reached with
all protocols.  The MX stuff for mail is improving, but even that is
still not nearly universal enough to rely on - ie: while my address is
kre@munnari.oz.au (or kre@cs.mu.oz.au) and most people reading this
message will be able to use that, I really need to also say that to
get mail to me you should use kre%munnari.oz.au@uunet.uu.net as for
many people only that works.  Since it can't be relied on, and has
certainly contributed to the fragmentation of naming amongst country
domains, it looks to have been the wrong thing to do (looking back
with hindsight - I would have made the same decision initillay).

ps: I will be interested to hear the result of the first application for
registration of a USSR military installation in the .MIL domain...  I
will soon (I hope) be in a position to be the mail forwarder for any such
site who would like to try this.
