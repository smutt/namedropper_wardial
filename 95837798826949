&gt; &gt;I'd rather see a few sites with misconfigured inverse mappings
&gt; &gt;becoming temporarily inconvenienced...

&gt; ... that the mere existence in some
&gt; resolver's cache of an .IN-ADDR.ARPA record for an internet address
&gt; means that activity apparently emanating from such an address can
&gt; always be traced to the person responsible.

No, this is true. However, insisting on reverse lookup gives you two
things.
1) It forces maintainers to put more effort into getting their DNS
system setup correctly. If they can't talk to you, and your important
enough it is a good impetus. If people can survive with the status
quo, there is no incentive to put effort into fixing broken things.

2) It is not solid, but it does give you an idea where to look when
trouble happens. If you can't reverse lookup an address, then you are
really stuck. If you can reverse lookup an address, you at least have
a starting point and it means if someone is trying to mess you about,
they have to work that much harder.

We had the same sort of problems in the U.K. a year or two back. We
had a central registry of hosts (still have (sigh!)), the NRS, but
people were very lax about registering anything in it. 

This was really awkward, we wanted to use this database to do name to
address lookup but it didn't contain half the people you wanted to
talk to.

Then, UCL CS department which ran the Internet/Janet gateway started
to insist that all incoming mail transfers could be reverse looked up
in this database, otherwise rejecting the mail (this has some sound
logical reasons too - if you can't find where the mail is coming from,
you won't be able to return it if it fails == black hole).  

This did not win them many friends to begin with as many sites could
not talk to people they wanted to. The result though now is that the
database has in it the vast majority of hosts on JANET and mail is a
lot more reliable.


You can't force people to register themselves, but you can make it
dammed awkward for them. From my limited experience of Internet DNS
usage, it appears to be getting more robust. Now is probably the time
to turn the screws down tighter and make people put more effort into
getting all their records straight.
