Here's the explanation from Robert Cole and the reason the NIC went with
"UK" vs "GB":

Subject:  Re:  UK.AC domain

Susan,
Here is our reply to your questions.

Background
The UK academic community have organsied a naming scheme, based on
domains, which is extensively used over here.
The scheme has its own
name tables with a large number of hosts in it.  The root domain of
this scheme is 'UK'.  This root was chosen becuase of the geographical
coverage of the computers in the scheme, viz Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.  The common notation for this is 'the United
Kingdom' (UK).  All international representation of this country uses
the term UK, not GB.   This is the rational for the choice of root in
the UK naming scheme.
The name was chosen by a group of experts, not by UCL, to be the best
position to adopt as we progress to International Standards.

GB vs UK.
The DARPA naming scheme suggests the use of ISO 3166 for top level
domains. You can see from the above argument that this is
inappropriate for a domain which consists of more than one country
used in ISO 3166.
In applying for this domain we
are effectively applying to register the UK scheme.  Obviously we
would like to maintain compatible names between the UK scheme and the
DARPA scheme.  One of the features of the DARPA scheme is to allow
mail exchange between DARPA hosts and others without source routing or
address modification.
When our registration is adopted, we will also register all the DARPA
domains in the UK scheme.  This action is merely waiting for the UCL
gateway to use the domain style names in its mail relay.

Why not EDU.
Whilst UCL itself could be in the EDU domain, the UK could not.  Note
that the UK domain contains a MOD and COmmercial subdomain as well as
the AC (academic community) domains.  RSRE will be part of the MOD
domain and are registered in the UK as such.  Since we are implicitly
registering the UK in the DARPA scheme it is inappropriate to be part
of the EDU domain.  UCL itself is registered in the UK domain and we
can see no advantages to being in the DARPA EDU domain as well.

Robert Cole.
