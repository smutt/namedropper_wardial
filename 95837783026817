I completely agree with James VanBokkelen's concerns about hidden hosts.

However, the issue is still real. Although the Internet architecture
was designed with complete openness as a goal, in the real world people
are going to want to hide things, for all sorts of bad, and maybe even
some good, reasons.

It seems that the question may be whether the hosts are COMPLETELY hidden.
If an Internet region can guarantee with pretty high certainty that
no IP datagrams from hidden hosts will ever escape their gateways
into the rest of the Internet, then there doesn't seem to be any reason
not to let them hide the names of such hosts.  This doesn't even seem to
be hard thing to do.  I believe at least one well-known gateway vendor 
already has flexible packet filters that could be used to enforce such a
restriction.  And enforcing such restrictions is the sort of thing that
bean counters LOVE to do, and do competantly; they might as well do it.

I think that we do need a general policy about this, approved by the IAB
and published in some RFC, that we can appeal to when (not if)
bad IP packets start showing up from hidden hosts.  

Comments?
