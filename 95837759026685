Hi.  I have been exploring ways to make life easier for our users to 
deal with subdomains and I came up with a creative use/abuse of cname
records that I don't know is "legal".  I would like to find out if this
use should/should not be allowed.

Basically this problem is that we are in a subdomain of purdue.edu called
"cs".  There is another subdomain called "ecn".  For a user in our department
to address a machine in the ecn department, he must use "host.ecn.purdue.edu".
We would like to use just "host.ecn".

One way would be to define a "local" top level domain called "ecn" with entries
for each ecn host under it that have cname records saying its real name is
"host.ecn.purdue.edu".  That requires 2 entries for each host - the real
entry and the one under the "local" top level domain.  I realize this would
cause us trouble if there ever came to be a top level domain called "ecn".
This is not where my question is, but it leads me to the next idea.

What if I were to have a record that indicated that the canonical name
for "ecn." is "ecn.purdue.edu"?  Thus with a name like "host.ecn", the
nameserver would see the top level domain "ecn.", see the cname record
for it, and substitute its canonical name creating "host.ecn.purdue.edu"
and repeat the lookup.

Is this clearly not a use for cname records or is it a use that had not
have been thought of before?
