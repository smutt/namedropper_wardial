    I was wondering if there are any recommended guidelines for 
    architecting DNS for a site (~1500 nodes).  For example,  # of 
    authoritative servers, # of resolvers per node, locality (e.g. 
    no more than 1 bridge or repeater away, etc.)?  Any RFC's or 
    other documents I can reference?
    

We've got a couple of very large domains within HP:  the Cupertino
site domain, cup.hp.com, and the Fort Collins site domain, fc.hp.com.

Our recommendations to their administrators when bringing up the
domains were:

- Delegate authority to fewer than 8 nameservers.  If you delegate to
  more than eight, the authority records and additional records won't
  all fit in one packet.

- But remember to delegate authority to all authoritative nameservers 
  remote from your site (pretty much common sense).  If you have a
  particular division or site that does a lot of business with you,
  they're probably a good choice for a secondary.

- You can have additional nameservers onsite that are authoritative
  for your "forward" (i.e., name to address) domain.  Just point
  resolvers at them and don't delegate to them.

- Place an authoritative nameserver on each subnet, in case of router
  problems.

- On the nameservers which you don't delegate to, you may only want
  to secondary for the in-addr.arpa domain(s) "local" to that
  nameserver.  That obviates the need to synch named boot files
  between those nameservers and the primary.

- Each major cluster probably deserves some kind of nameserver.  If
  you're already overloaded (e.g., administratively, or in terms of
  update load) with authoritative nameservers, use caching-only
  nameservers, which are considerably less taxing.

There are lots of other subtle issues regarding forwarders &amp; such. 
I'd be happy to talk to you about them (even though you're the
competition!) if you're curious or have special concerns.
