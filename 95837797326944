Here is what is possible:

Any domain can use MX to specify one or preferably more hosts with
valid internet addresses as mail exchanges.  The domain may or may not
have its own IP address.  The target of the MX must talk SMTP, and
hence must have at least one IP address.

Thus if we have:

Alpha	MX	10	Beta

Alpha may or may not have an IP address, Beta must talk SMTP and have
an IP address.

The mail exchange (Beta) can use any means it likes to get mail to the
ultimate destination (Alpha).  This could be multiple UUCP hops, MCI
mail, the pony express, whatever.

A mail exchange can perform that service for any number of other
domains, and the domains don't have to be related (in the sense of
name) to the mail exchange or to each other.

Here is what is impossible:

The mail exchange specified as the target of MX doesn't have an IP
address just more MX.  (This is not to say you couldn't create a
system that did this, just that the rest of the world doesn't work
that way.)

Note that this is often confused with using repeated SMTPs through
mail exchanges of different preferences (that number in the MX).  The
point is that the target never changes until you get to some mail
exchange which uses a non-SMTP delivery method.

Thus with regard to the original question, while you cannot be the
target of an MX without being able to receive SMTP/have an IP address,
there is nothing to prevent one mail exchange host from serving as the
target of multiple other domains.
