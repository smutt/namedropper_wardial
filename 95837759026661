        Having set up my stage, here's the basic problem.  There are several
    hosts which offer gateway service between the different mail networks.
    For example CSNET-RELAY (aka RELAY.CS.NET) between CSNET and the Internet,
    and SEISMO.CSS.GOV between UUCP and the Internet.  How are these gateways
    to decide how to route mail to a host, if that host is on more than
    one administrative network?

Respect the preference requested by the site (domain) you are sending to.

        For example, imagine A.ATT.COM (a phoney host name).  ATT.COM is/will
    be on both CSNET and UUCP, and thus A.ATT.COM can be reached through
    either network.  Now I am on LOKI.BBN.COM, an Internet host, and
    mail to JOE@A.ATT.COM.  My mailer, since I am only on the Internet,
    queries the domain database and finds the following information (which
    is purely hypothetical -- I do not know which way ATT may choose
    to route their mail):

        ; mail thru RELAY preferred over SEISMO
        *.ATT.COM.	IN	MX	10	RELAY.CS.NET.   ; CSNET relay
        *.ATT.COM.	IN	MX	20	SEISMO.CSS.GOV. ; UUCP gateway

    it tries to deliver to RELAY and fails and passes the message instead
    of SEISMO.  Now what is SEISMO supposed to do?  It is on the Internet,
    so it could wait for RELAY (the preferred Internet relay) to come up
    and then pass the message on to RELAY, or since it is on UUCP along
    with ATT, SEISMO can choose to send the message via UUCP.  Which
    is SEISMO expected to do?  

Try to send via RELAY, for as long as appropriate, then give up, and
use the secondary route.

    I'm sort of inclined to say it sends to
    ATT via UUCP, despite the fact this may surprise people on the Internet.

Only if the Internet approach seems to not be working.

    In other words, once mail reaches a gateway host it is considered to
    have crossed into the new network (if that makes sense).

Not always.

        But there are odd problems with this system.  What happens to mail
    for ATT originating on SEISMO.  SEISMO is an Internet host, and the
    domain system indicates that given their druthers, ATT would like Internet
    mail routed via CSNET.  Should SEISMO send to RELAY.CS.NET? 

So what is the question?  Try your best to use the Internet (like Ma said
to), and use UUCP if necessary (i.e. same as above; it doesn't matter if
the mail originates locally)

        More generally, the system suggests that mail within an administrative
    domain will tend to stay there. Mail originating within CSNET and destined
    for a host which is both on CSNET and UUCP, will stay within CSNET.

I see no reason for it to blindly do this.

    The
    CSNET relay, having been conditioned to believe that mail sent to it is
    destined for CSNET will not consult the Internet domain database for
    information about hosts it knows how to reach.

Shouldn't do it this way (see above).

        Does this feel like the right way to do things at the gateways?

No.

    Has anyone got better suggestions?  

Yes.

    Let me point out one small restriction
    here for those who have better ideas -- some mail systems split apart
    the functions of receiving and sending mail -- so it is highly likely
    that at the time the CSNET relay (or some other mail gateway) is 
    deciding where to send a message, it probably no longer knows from
    what network the message came in from (particularly if the names in
    the headers no longer convey this information).

Irrelevant anyway.

    So any scheme which
    says "if it comes in from this net, try to send it out the other net"
    probably doesn't work.

What about sites on three networks?  EDDIE.MIT.EDU for example.  This
idea just doesn't work.
