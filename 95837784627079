&gt;Well, the fact is that assumption 3 is false. It is sometime difficult
&gt;to enter a campus network (try Berkeley), and it is costly to cross a
&gt; ...

I supose it doesn't make any difference what a netw.adm. at a Swedish
University says in this debate, but still it needs to be said:

The Nordic countries have been connected to the Internet for almost
exactly one year now and except for some initial routing problems
(which is not at all surprising given the size of the Internet!)
things have worked well.

We, (chalmers.se) started really using MX records in the beginning
of February this year and have not had more severe problems than we
have on campus (no, although not perfect we're not extremely bad :-).
I have actually "tried Berkeley" quite a few times and can not report
of any worse problems than long character delays. Since we only have
a single link to the Internet we (or the US :-) get somewhat isolated
when that link breaks, but that's a fact of life.

What has caused problems, though, is sending mail to domains within
Europe, where the DNS often gives us to a host somewhere in the US,
while we possibly should hand the mail to some host here in Europe.
Even worse - we might get the address of a host in Europe, which we
either can't reach at all (usually the US can't reach it either!)
or we are not allowed to connect to.

Now, instead of suggesting various kludges to the DNS I think we
should go ahead and start building a European Internet - now!

There's no fancy new technology involved, so technically it can be
done in *very* short time. While we're waiting for real standards,
a number of people will have a useful service and we may get some
experience from working with big, real, networks. Later, when the
standards are stable we migrate into them, just as everybody else.

Finally: I am aware of the work that is going on to create a real
European Internet and I do hope that work will be a success. Still,
I cannot understand why that is not considered part of any official
European networking strategy - why Europe should wait instead of
getting something non-standard (but operational) in the air today,
use it while waiting for standards and finally migrate to standards.
