    Regarding Charles Hornig's message to the effect that virtually no one
    on the net seemed to understand his host's new domain name:
    ...
    (3) I would strongly suggest that the new domain names for the various
	hosts be entered into HOSTS.TXT.  Otherwise, I don't see any reason-
	able way that a host can start using its new name, since a goodly
	(albeit hopefully decreasing over time) portion of the net will sim-
	ply not know for some time to come what in the world to do with a
	name that doesn't appear in the HOSTS.TXT file.

	I would also submit that the current official names and nicknames
	MUST also be retained in HOSTS.TXT, by the way, along with the new
	domain names.  This must be done in order to insure an orderly tran-
	sition from the old names to the new.

    I had been blithely assuming that the NIC host tables would show
    the domain-format names of hosts as people move to using domains.
    I think any attempt to make a smooth transition is doomed to failure
    if this doesn't happen.   Does anyone know whether this is just
    an oversight?  Are we going to have different host names depending
    upon what authority we look them up in?  I thought that was the whole
    point of moving to the new format HOSTS.TXT, with the domain included.
    A host doesn't have to be very "upscale" to handle that.
    -------

I asked the NIC to do this.  They said that they "were not yet ready"
(as of 3/22/85), but would put them in when they were.  They still
aren't there.  A quick check shows that there are no names in domains
other than .ARPA in the NIC host table.
