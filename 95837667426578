Paul:

Thanks for pointing out these problems.  As Rice was one of the more
oft-mentionted offenders, I thought a brief reply would be in order.

	"Ask RICE.EDU, using 192.5.58.6, for all information for
	RICE.EDU, and you get a message back from 128.42.3.2."

This is a bug in the 4.2bsd networking code.  We have the necessary
fix, but I have been unsuccessful at motivating certain people to
install it.  I guess it's time to walk down the hall and threaten
violence again...

I should point out that part of the problem is that the address for
RICE.EDU, 192.5.58.6, has no fixed association with any host at Rice.
It was recently moved to accomodate certain hardware and
telecommunications line changes, and because of a configuration file
oddity, the aforementioned bug was exposed.  We'll work on it.

	"If you use the IN-ADDR tree to get a host name corresponding
	to a Internet address, you are supposed to get a pointer (PTR)
	RR to the primary name of the host, not a list of aliases or
	whatever."

At least in our case, those replies are coming from the NIC, not from
a RICE.EDU nameserver.  When I try to resolve 2.3.42.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA,
I get back RICE-TETHYS.ARPA and RICE-GATEWAY.ARPA, domain names which
are not part of our zone, and certainly not in our database.

	"Backup servers which don't backup."

Currently, Rice and Purdue, like most other site pairs which use BIND,
sinply download each other's zones at boot.  This practice is
tremendously convenient, though of course not really robust.  Recently,
in fact, the Purdue nameserver failed to download our zone, I presume
because of a network outage, and happily told everyone who asked that
our hosts did not exist.

Perhaps a better practice would be for BIND to write out a text version
of the downloaded zone whenever the serial field was found to have
increased, and use that text version when the download fails.  Are you
listening, Kevin?

	"XXX delegates to ZZZ.XXX, the XXX and ZZZ.XXX servers should
	have identical lists of NS RRs for ZZZ.XX."

That never occurred to me.  I'll fix it.
