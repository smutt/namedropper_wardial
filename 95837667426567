At the moment, TOPS-20 does not yet have a resolver.  Our Unix
systems do not have resolvers in any practical sense.  I.e.
we are not yet running 4.3, and we haven't yet gotten far 
enough into the mail software to want to install it ourselves.
I would guess that it is going to be at least 6 months before
all of our machines have resolvers.  So far, most of our
effort has gone into machines sure that all of our machines
can even handle names with domains in them.  This has been
fairly successful, except that our VMS systems can't, because
we don't have source to the Wollongong code and they don't
seem to be wiling to do an interim fix to allow domains in
/etc/hosts.  (I agree with them that a full resolver system
is too big for us to expect a quick fix.  But removing the
code that tacks on .ARPA doesn't seem such a big deal.)

I realize that under ARPAnet policy, we are responsible
for implementing domain handling on all of our systems.  If
other sites decide to be unfriendly, we will do this by
adding names to hosts.txt manually as we need to talk to them.
But I would consider it a great personal favor if everybody
would try to avoid using names that are not in hosts.txt
until mail systems that use domain servers are not only
debugged, but have made it through the mail from all the
various vendors to us.  (Actually, 6 months is probably
optimistic, isn't it.)
