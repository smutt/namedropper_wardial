Background:

    I recently stated the opinion that every host name used in a "From:"
    line of an ARPA Internet message should appear in the NIC host name
    table (not just in the domain data base) -- in order that hosts
    still using the NIC table can figure out where to send the mail.

    Bill Wells pointed out that Berkeley has lots of entities in its
    BERKELEY.EDU domain which are not on packet networks and which
    therefore cannot be listed in the NIC table (since they don't have
    Internet addresses).

    Dennis Rockwell then reminded us that the "MF" (mail forwarder)
    resource record exists for this very purpose -- and urged the
    designers and maintainers of mail systems to issue QTYPE=MAILA
    queries on destination domain names (and issue QTYPE=A queries only
    if QTYPE=MAILA returns no information).

    I decided to post this follow-up to NAMEDROPPERS because I felt it
    was a more appropriate forum for the technical issues involved than
    HEADER-PEOPLE.  Since most NAMEDROPPERS recipients are supposedly
    on HEADER-PEOPLE as well, I assume that everyone reading this saw
    the previous messages as well.

I wholeheartedly agree with Dennis's comments.  Mail systems should
unquestionably look first for mail-related domain information (MD and
MF RR's; eventually, MB and MR RR's as well).  A-type RR's should be
used only as a last resort if no specifically mail-realted RR's are
found for the destination domain.

&gt;From a realistic standpoint, however, we need to keep in mind the way
that many (I won't necessarily say "most", since I don't know for sure)
hosts are going to be handling the conversion to the data base system,
at least initially.

The easiest method for converting to the new system is for one to simply
replace the old "name-to-address" library routine (which consulted the
NIC table, or a hashed version of same) with a new library routine which
uses a resolver to consult the domain data base.  Such a routine would
typically have exactly the same parameters as the routine it replaced,
so that the actual program -- TELNET, FTP, mailer, server daemon, or
whatever -- would not have to be modified at all.

The "-lresolv" library (included as part of the 4.2BSD UNIX name server,
BIND) is a typical example of this approach to conversion.

This method, however, has two serious drawbacks:

(1) I would guess that the vast majority of existing network-related
    programs use a very simple library routine which maps a given host
    name into one or more addresses, without regard to what kind of
    service is to be sought on the remote host.  (This is only natural,
    considering that the "available services" information in the NIC
    table never indicates that different services are to be requested
    from different addresses.  Rather than see whether a given host
    advertises a given service, it was always much easier simply to try
    to connect to the well-known port and see what happened.)

    As a result, I would predict that 99%+ of all queries to name
    servers will be for A-type RR's only.  After all (so the simple
    substitute library routine would think -- if it could think :-}),
    if all I am trying to do is map a name into an address, why should
    I care about any type of RR other than A?

(2) The domain data base system introduces a new kind of error condition
    -- namely, "temporary failure".  Unfortunately, I suspect that many
    of the "quick-and-dirty" drop-in substitutes for the old NIC-table
    library routines are simply going to map this condition into the
    single, catch-all error category -- which the application program
    will undoubtedly interpret as meaning "no such host".

    As a result, I would predict that a temporary unavailability of part
    or all of the domain data base will result in mail to valid hosts
    being rejected with the claim that the requested host doesn't exist.

Since a fair proportion of the net is probably going to use this method
of conversion, at least initially -- whether we like it or not -- I
would be reluctant to rely on MF-type RR's in the domain data base in
order to accomplish anything interesting in the near future.

And, of course, there's still the question of what the MILNET people are
going to do if they want to send mail to CSNET's new domain -- or to one
of Berkeley's myriad hosts -- with only the NIC table as a guide.

So, for the time being, I continue to hold my original opinion that all
domain names used in mail addresses should be listed in the NIC table.
If an organization cannot (or chooses not to) list some name in the NIC
table, for whatever reason, then I don't think that name should be used
as the domain in a return address.  Rather, the unlisted name should be
"hidden" in the local-part (via the "%" hack), and some other domain
name which is in the NIC table should be used to the right of the "@" in
the address.

A reasonable timetable should be set for remedying this problem --
taking into account the MILNET's actions relating to the domain data
base, as well as the issue of making better name-&gt;address mapping rou-
tines available to those organizations which haven't the time or exper-
tise to write such routines themselves.  Whether we like it or not, I
think it is clear by now that the RFC921 timetable has slipped badly and
is in need of revision.

In retrospect, maybe it might have been better not to put A-type RR's in
the domain data base at all -- but instead to make people find addresses
from WKS RR's.  This would have forced everyone, right from the start,
to think about exactly what service they planned to seek when asking
questions about a given domain name.  The idea of looking for MD and MF
RR's when looking for mail service for a domain would then have been a
logical extension to the general procedure.  Doing things this way would
admittedly have forced people to go to some extra trouble in converting
existing software (since a direct replacement for the simple name-to-
address query would not be possible) -- but since it's now obvious that
they'll have to go to this extra trouble anyway, this approach would
probably have paid off in the long run.  Ah well, so much for 20-20
hindsight.
