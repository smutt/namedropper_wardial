	X.400 makes some suggestions that are relevant here; in
	particular, para 3.3.1 suggests that different management
	domains could choose different attributes.  I believe that it
	suggests:

		- for commercial users: Country, organization name,
		organizational unit, (position or role, surname, and
		given name)

		- for residential users: Country, region, town, and
		street names; number on street; surname, given name

		- for ``architectural'' specification: country and
		management-domain names, unique number within
		management domain

While going along with X.400 has much to be said for it, some things
worry me:

(1) If we start to put home computers in the US domain, we have to accept
that someday soon we'll be sharing that domain with the real X.400 universe.
This raises some coordination issues, such as "will X.400 take us seriously?"
(So far they haven't, after all, we aren't an international standard.  As
yet, I don't know if any body in the USA with the charter to allocate the
names, and the only implementor in the USA I've asked about this said they
were using their own ADMD (as expected by today's X.400) which allows them
to subdivide it any way they like, and hadn't thought about the directory
sharing issues.

(2) This structure is set up to handle zillions of home users.  In reality,
so far there aren't all that many.  A survey a year ago found, in the USA,
a total of 6 home computers registered on UUCP (compared to 400 companies,
125 universities, 6 government orgs, 6 military.)  It is growing, but so
far the explosive growth seems to be among small companies - there are lots
of 1 or 2 person consulting companies out there with a UNIX machine.

(3) As pointed out, postal addresses change when a person moves, and it
would be nice to have a structure that doesn't change so easily.  (This
may be a minor point.)

&gt;From an implementation point of view, I think that 3rd level domains would
be most expediant to implement at the current time.  A 2nd level domain
service would have to spring up to form such a domain.  This doesn't mean
this is the right way to do it, but unless we expect explosive growth in
this area in the next 5 or 10 years, (outside of X.400) it may be best
to take the currently easiest method.

If we do that, where does the 2nd level domain go?  Could go under ORG,
or under NET, or maybe even be merged in with the 1 man companies under
COM 3rd level domains.  I kind of like ORG, from what I've read so far.

How else do we organize it?  Seems to me that each 2nd level domain has
to be all on one network, such as UUCP, in this category.  (We don't want
the 4 networks worrying about each individual user.)  If there are to be
more than 1 2nd level domain (no sense having a monopoly) on the same net,
how should they divide up the users?  Could be geographic, or could be
ad-hoc (people go to any one they like) or by first letter of last name,
or the whole thing could be moot because of lack of interest.  (I only
see one such 3rd level domain on UUCP for now.)  Personally, I lean
toward ad-hoc.  That encourages competition and makes it easier to keep
your address when you move, but it's kind of like using an ADMD.
