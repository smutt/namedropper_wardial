&gt;Consider a site (foo.org) with many small user machines (ie

&gt;What if someone once saw me logged into bar.foo.org, and decides to send
&gt;me mail there.  I may not be using that machine any more; in fact it may
&gt;not be running a working mail server.  What I really want is to provide
&gt;MX records for *.foo.org and have all mail be handled by one of the
&gt;central mail depositories.
&gt;
&gt;What you propose would break this.  Is it an invalid use of MX records?

No. There is a subtle difference between having a uniform addressing scheme
and actually using it as the internal addressing scheme.

Consider a scenario in which we have a site as you describe it. Some file
servers, lots of personal workstations. Such a site should choose to hide
the names of all internal machines behind a single machine, or behind a
number of mail servers. Each of the mail servers will massage outgoing mail
such that return addresses point to the sender's mail server. External people
will reply to the mail server (which if down may have MX records pointing to
a secondary mail server which may also perform the final delivery).

This way, changes to the internal database which controls automatic forwarding,
and/or to .forward files will be sufficient to redirect mail to the respective
sender's preferred mail reading host. Also, if all machines support a rewriting
schema in which internal return addresses are changed to the user's mailhost
address (for internal mail), even internal correspondents will not (have to)
know from which physical machine the message was sent (unless they inspect
Received: lines).

Using a uniform addressing scheme with generic aliasing and forwarding will
eliminate the need for both internal and external correspondents to know the
name of some recipient's machine. This also allows maintainers to restrict
updates to a single database of forwarding and aliasing information, which is
propagated between mail servers (e.g. by means of rdist).
