Bob,

CMU has on various systems various flavors of mechanism you propose.
Alas, what you really want instead of those mechanisms which confuses
and infuriates many non-programmers if some type of AI mechanism that
understands your needs and wants and just does what you mean.

On the serious side, simple mechanisms that map one string to another
string in a system wide context do not adapt to enviromental changes.
This is true of people's last names and names of hosts. At CMU we try
to match on people's ids and last names, we have discovered when a
person comes in with an id or last name similiar to someone elses,
people scream "why is my mail for X, new member, not going to X and
instead going to X'"!!

For instance, id "siegel" versus several people with the last name of
"siegel"? Who gets the mail if it is addressed to siegel? The id or
does it get rejected as ambiguous? What about two people with similar
last names:  Lehman and Lehmann. What about two people on different
machines with the same last name that eventually get on the same
machine with each other? Who wins?  The person who was there first or
the person with the bigger status in the organization?

Private lists as also problems. We have lots of people that give away
"free gifts" of login and set up profiles. You are new and some
helpful co-worker says "let me help -- I have some real neat stuff".
Next thing you know, your mail is sent to the wrong place or -- in a
more business like example -- a new secretary sends mail for her boss
for the first time....he may be an extensive computer user...terse
output and wicked aliases which cause him to send mail to the wrong
"Bob".

The model you want to shoot for is like your local neighborhood
postman. He knows your name, what you tend to get in the mail and the
adddresses past history. Therefore if someone uses the phonetic
spelling or does a typo of your name, he understands and delivers it
to you. If they totally blow it with the address and works the entire
street, he can usually figure out what is the correct street number
or apartment number or correct street name.

Even this model breaks down when the postal worker turn over rate is
high and the buildings are high-occupancy apartments with a high
occupant turn over rate.

Therefore, given computers are still not smart enough to do a job
that your co-workers do or your secretary does....we have to have
concrete problems to solve in this evolutionary step of electronic
mail. What are they? Simple:
	- shorthand names to save people typing time or space
	in their screen menus or whatever.
	- absolute user@name addresses that work independent of
	the network or host and don't wrap around the screen.

Of course the reality is that people will use nicknames in
inappropraite context just like some people do at parties or at
meetings and that absolute names are never absolute enough (look at
the telephone system...is there an absolute phone number for your
house independent of country or state or time?).

As for host names at CMU, we are using a search list mechanism since
we have a highly distributed host name space and only have 3 of many
organizations cooperating for a flat name space. Therefore, a name
like "A" or "TEST1" gets tried under .CS.CMU.EDU, .RI.CMU.EDU,
.ECE.CMU.EDU and then gives up.  Names ending with a trailing period
are considered absolute. It seems to be working well for about 300
users so far and it is expected by me to have an order of magnitude
more people using it by January 1st 1987. (Back to work.)
