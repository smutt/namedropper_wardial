This is a reply to the various responses that I received about my
"private hosts" message.

The gist of the responses is that with "official" (I'll come to that
in a moment) hidden hosts, the participants in the Internet would be
faced with problems like:

- How do you deal with a hidden host's probing or anti-social
  behavior?

- How do you deal with a hidden host's interesting or bogus packets?

- Several people pointed out that modern terminal servers allow a user
  to anonymously connect around the Internet at will.  How do you deal
  with that capability (regardless of whether or not the terminal
  server is private or not).

On the plus side, if you can find out about the host, you might be
more willing to help the host resolve its problems.

Also, several people mentioned that "security through obscurity" is
not an effective solution.


I claim that the private hosts problem is a current problem and must
be addressed by the Internet community.  (In other words, my proposal
didn't create the problem and in fact may be part of the solution.)
Perhaps I am somewhat cynical, but I would be surprized if there is a
significant number of sites which don't already have private hosts of
one sort or another (hence the earlier quotes around the word
"official").  Private hosts can result from ignorance on the part of
the domain administrator, organizational politics, kludges at
supporting "private hosts," or simple mistakes and forgetfulness.  How
do we deal with them?

An Internet policy on private hosts would provide a framework on
dealing with them.  Defining (quasi-)official support for private
hosts might well make it easier to track down problem hosts because
they would at least be registered somewhere where a responsible person
could find them, instead of hiding in a kludged hole.  (That is what I
meant by my proposal being part of the solution.)


I also realized that I had left some relevant information out of my
previous message:

- I recognize that the proposal is not a complete privacy solution.
  We have taken (and will take) additional steps including physical
  separation of networks, limitations on IP routing, and
  authentication in order to provide full privacy.  All these steps
  will allow us to provide (1) better, more reliable service to our
  customers and (2) more secure service.  Contrary to what one might
  expect, doing (2) better makes it easier to do (1) better.

- We program our terminal servers to only let users connect to local
  hosts.  The now identified user can run telnet from there to connect
  further.

- We are already using "nonsense" (i.e., non-descriptive) host names.

- Our private hosts (including terminal servers) are not directly
  accessible from the Internet.  Thus, "ping"ing them would not work.

- The reference to Multics was to clarify by example the discussion of
  access lists.  However, I also subscribe to the idea of "security
  by fully-examined design."  I did not mean to imply that the
  proposal was by itself a complete solution.

Our working rule on this issue is that if machine A can talk to (i.e.,
exchange packets with) machine B, then A and B are not private with
respect to each other.  (This rule is NOT transitive!)

Conversely, if A and B are private with respect to each other, they
cannot exchange packets.  Any such exchange is a prima facie privacy
breach and must be fixed.

These rules might form the basis of an Internet policy.  Something
like, "its ok to have private hosts, but it is their administrator's
responsibility to keep them to themselves."

In summary, we're trying to be part of the solution, not the
problem...
