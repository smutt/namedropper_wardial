  Since the domain
  system is (modulo a few rough edges) readily extensible to new QTYPEs
  and QCLASSes, adding things such as ISO addresses shouldn't be too hard.
  ISO names would be more problematic, though.  The set of allowable names
  would have to be restricted to those that can be represented in the
  hierarchical fashion that the domain system requires.

I suspect that this would be fairly unsatisfactory.  Although X.500
provides a hierarchy, each component of a full path name consists of a
set of attributes.  This is an important aspect of X.500 and is the
basis of much of its interesting and flexible functionality.

  	In some circles, thought has been given to the opposite
  approach, replacing the current domain system with X.500.  I believe
  that Dave Clark's people at MIT are looking at whether this would be
  feasible.  Unfortunately, full implementation of the X.500 spec is still
  beyond the current state of the art in computer science .

There are in fact a number of fairly complete implementations
underway, most notably Steve Kille's Quipu project at UCL.  In
addition, an incomplete list of other implementors includes Retix, U.
of British Columbia, MIT (me), NIST, Wollongong, one or more in Italy
(I'm not sure of the organizations there), KDD (Japan)...

The real problem with saying that an implementation of X.500 is
complete is that the spec is incomplete, so implementations must amke
assumptions, which unless carefully designed will conflict with the
assumptions made in other implementations, preventing interworking
among them.
