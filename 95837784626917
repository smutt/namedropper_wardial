I think we are agreeing violently.  From my point of view, there are two
issues:

1) Who gets what name, and how are names allocated and organized.

2) How do we communicate the results of (1).

In the context of the DNS, most of (1) is political.  For example, emptying
.ARPA and whether there is a US on the end.  From a technical
point of view, the issues are insuring that we can generate unique names
while distributing control.  There is the still unsolved issue of
shorthands and what they expand to.

The second issue is where we may part company.  I don't see any point in
reserving names without marking reservations in the database.  That is,
the database is the name space.  Perhaps what you are saying is that the
NIC should be willing to allocate names just as they do IP addresses.
Thus I could get an "unconnected" name without being connected to the
Internet in any way (mail or otherwise).  From the database's point of
view this would require some RR to "mark" the name.  In the present
scheme, we typically do this with an MX, on the perhaps unwarranted
assumption of near-universal mail connectivity.

The name server requirement has to do with giving away a zone, which is
a domain along with the authority to manage names within the domain.
You could reserve a domain without nameservers, but you do need to put
something there, and I suppose we could define a way to just say
"allocated but nothing there yet."

The bottom line is that maybe we do need a technical way (actually a
procedure, we have the means, say a TXT RR) to put in such a mark.  Of
course, this would open up a vast political can of worms about who gets
what names.
