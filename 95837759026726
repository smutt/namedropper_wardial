    I think the note on this subject was unduly pessimistic.

    The problem is that for several months we've been mired at a funny
point in the conversion.  Everything except mail works just fine, but
because mail systems were required to change their behaviour concurrently
with changing the way they get host information, their conversion has
taken longer.  Meanwhile, some people have come to feel the domain system
is mostly working, and it is time to take the plunge.  Voila! A bit of
a mess as we try to muddle through using two naming systems, with
mailers lagging behind.

    I believe the situation is on the verge of improving very
shortly.  Mailers which understand how to send mail using MX RR's
are beginning to appear and be distributed.  It will soon be true
that machines running UNIX on the Internet will have little excuse for
not using mailers that understand MX RRs.  Converting all UNIX machines
would move the Internet conversion along quite a bit.

    Furthermore, even if I am a bit biased as an author of one of the
relevant RFCs, our experience at CSNET is that the new mailing system
seems to work quite nicely.   We've been running our mailer on sh.cs.net
(aka csnet-sh.arpa) with domains for many weeks now.  Minor glitches in
the domain system are quite common, the mail is getting through.  The
higher performance requirements of the CSNET relay have kept us from
fully converting it to using the domain servers instead of the NIC table,
but we are ready to make this conversion and will when the system becomes a
bit more stable.
