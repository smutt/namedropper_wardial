Karl:

The last paragraph of RFC 974 was intended to deal with this question:

   Finally, it should be noted that this is a standard for routing on
   the Internet.  Mailers serving hosts which lie on multiple networks
   will presumably have to make some decisions about which network to
   route through. This decision making is outside the scope of this
   memo, although mailers may well use the domain system to help them
   decide.  However, once a mailer decides to deliver a message via the
   Internet it must apply these rules to route the message.

To put that a bit more bluntly -- if a system is on more than one network,
routing gets much more painful, and how you deal with it isn't within
the scope of the memo.  The reason I took that position was that:

    (a) I believed (and still believe) a universal panacea doesn't
	exist.  So I wasn't in a position to say "all gateways do this."
	I did write a paper for the Summer 1986 USENIX, discussing
	in broad terms what might go wrong at a gateway -- your
	problem is one of the ones listed.

    (b) 1986 was the good old days when hosts on multiple networks
	(e.g. UUCP, BITNET, Internet) were rare, and were all run
	by expert e-mail gateway hackers who kept in touch with
	each other.  Personally I view running a system on multiple
	networks akin to playing with matches -- you have to be
	very careful (and a little lucky) not to burn the house
	down.

It seems to me that, in this context, the fidonet guys are doing a
semi-reasonable thing.  They are running a gateway.  They get mail via
the Internet, and forward it via UUCP.  A simple move from one network
to the next.  The problem comes when that UUCP path intersects another
UUCP/Internet system, which decides to make the message cross network
boundaries again.

The MX system sort of assumes that once out of the system, a message won't
be re-inserted.  (Once a message leaves the Internet, it better not come back).
The Fidonet folk are working on this assumption -- that when their message
goes onto UUCP, it won't return to haunt them.  About the only thing
I think one might complain about is that they might have taken some time
to check that this was, in fact, true, and that there was no system in
their UUCP paths that would fight back.  On the other hand, given the
large number of split-personality hosts out there, I'm not sure they
can be expected to know what systems might cause trouble.
