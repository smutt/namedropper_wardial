   From: eckert@fauern.UUCP  (Toerless Eckert)

   1 The current setup is intentionally to allow full use of the DNS for
     all those sites in germany who cannot currently reach the US-
     or even european Internet, but who want to use the DNS nevertheless,
     and not only for domainname to address resolution, but also vice versa.

   2 Domains which have network reachability only within germany are DNS
     registered with the DE. zone on unido (unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de),
     and have their according IN-ADDR.ARPA. zone set up in a similar way by
     faked entries in the unido... DNS server. These domains have usually only
     MX records to their preferred forwarder for E-mail in the official DE zone
     on uunet.uu.net.

   3 Domains under DE having aquired full US and European Internet connectivity
     are also entered into the official DE zone on uunet.uu.net (and of
     course on the DE zone on unido...).

   4 All german DNS installations are obliged to use unido... as a forwarder,
     so that those domains under (2) are correctly resolved, and not only those
     from the DE zone, but the IN-ADDR.ARPA. zones too.

   5 The administrative responsibility for the DE domain is handed to
     the University of Dortmund, which runs unido..., this applies for
     the official DE zone from uunet too. The DFN has no cards in the DNS,
     but owns the DBP.DE zone.

   ...

I still want to know why you think that you have to do it that way.

If the DE. zones on uunet and unido were made identical, which
specific regulations would it break? Which specific organizations
would take action against you for other reasons? Which specific
functions of the network would cease to work?

&gt;From what I know, the answers are none, none, and none, and nothing in
your article contradicts this.

On the other hand, I know that there are functions that would _start_
to work if the zones were identical.
