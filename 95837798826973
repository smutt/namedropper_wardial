Now, I came late into this, so it's probably mentioned already. Anyway:

In article &lt;3675.650616417@cs.nott.ac.uk&gt;
    j.onions@computer-science.nottingham.ac.uk (Julian Onions) writes:

&gt;           However, insisting on reverse lookup gives you two things.
&gt;1) It forces maintainers to put more effort into getting their DNS
&gt;system setup correctly. If they can't talk to you, and your important
&gt;enough it is a good impetus. If people can survive with the status
&gt;quo, there is no incentive to put effort into fixing broken things.

Unfortunately, not everybody can get registered in the .IN-ADDR.ARPA
domain, at least not today. To get a NS(.IN-ADDR.ARPA) registered you
need to have "Connected Status", which in turn implies that you're
allowed to access the Internet - the US Internet! Exactly what the
requirements for "Connected Status" are I don't know, but I don't
think you get it just by asking.

On the Swedish IP network there are quite a few organizations that
will never get "Connected Status" - some of them probably don't care,
since all they need is access to their cooperating universities. If we
were to enforce DNS lookups, all such cooperation would be impossible!

Of course, there is the other way to solve the problem, i.e. to drop
the requirement for "Connected Status" to register a NS(.IN-ADDR.ARPA)
(the actual NS host will need to have "Connected Status", but that's
another story). I would be surprised if this suggestion is in any way
new, but I wanted to mention it anyway.
