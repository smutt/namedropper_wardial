The long-awaited BIND (Berkeley Internet Name-Domain software) version 4.8
is now available.  It can be obtained by anonymous FTP from host
ucbarpa.Berkley.EDU from file pub/4.3/bind.4.8.tar or pub/4.3/bind.4.8.tar.Z
(compressed).  That file contains notes on the changes in this version
and the installation procedure.  It also contains an updated version
of the BIND Operations Guide.  This version replaces the last official
release of BIND (4.5) and the last test release (4.7.3).  All sites running
any earlier version of BIND are encouraged to upgrade.  This version
fixes numerous bugs in previous versions, some of which cause repeated
transmissions of recursive queries.  One such bug was recently fixed
that is exercised by recent changes in the root servers for caching
of negative responses.  Additional details on this subject are in
an excerpt from the change list at the end of this message.

Along with the updated server, this release includes new resolver features
allowing per-user host aliases and multiple levels of searching for an
incomplete name.  The hostname resolution procedure is described in a new
manual page, hostname(7).  The sendmail mailer has been updated to use
these facilities; sources for that version of sendmail will also be
available on ucbarpa in a day or two.

Announcements of new versions of BIND, bug fixes and discussion of current
issues for sites using the Berkeley nameserver are found on the mailing
list bind@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU.  Requests to be added to that list should
be sent to bind-request@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU.  As that list has grown quite
large, I would encourage sites with multiple subscribers to use local
redistribution lists.

&gt;From the file CHANGES:

There have been numerous changes to named, fixing most of the known
bugs that can be fixed without major structural changes in the server.
Several server configurations that failed before should now work.
Certain robustness problems have been fixed, in particular bounds-
checking when processing incoming packets.  Two changes have been made
in preparation for negative caching: SOA records are sent in the authority
section in negative responses with NXDOMAIN set, and a bug was fixed that
caused confusion and repeated requests if a response had no error, no answer
and an SOA in the authority section.  As such responses are already sent
by other servers, and will be sent by the next release of BIND, it is
important that all sites upgrade to this version as quickly as possible.

The root "hint" cache and cache file remain the largest problem area,
along with named's naivete in accepting bogus server's data.
These will be addressed in the next release, along with asynchronous
zone transfers, intelligent reloading of zone files, faster startup,
and caching of negative responses.
