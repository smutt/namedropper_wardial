Re: insisting on inverse mappings:

Hmm, I'm interested in this discussion, having just been involved in
an argument with a site that refuses connections to sites that won't
inverse map.  Can someone quote chapter and verse from an RFC that
says that a host's IP address should inverse map via DNS before it can
make a connection?  All I can find that seems relevant is from Host
Requirements II, RFC 1123:

   2.2  Using Domain Name Service

      Host domain names MUST be translated to IP addresses as described
      in Section 6.1.

      Applications using domain name services MUST be able to cope with
      soft error conditions.  Applications MUST wait a reasonable
      interval between successive retries due to a soft error, and MUST
      allow for the possibility that network problems may deny service
      for hours or even days.

Do these systems that reject connections based on no inverse mapping
allow for this sort of error?

I guess the philosophy puzzles me.  I've always thought of DNS as a
way of making it easier for clients to connect to services, not as any
sort of authentication system.

At this site we have 2000 machines on LocalTalk networks using dynamic
IP address assignment and supporting no IP services.  Is it really
necessary for security for us to give them all names (actually, give
the addresses names) and put them in our domain database?  Surely if
intrusive activity is coming from one of these machines it's easy to
determine where it's at by looking at the network part of its IP
address?
