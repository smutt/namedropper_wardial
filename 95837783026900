larry,

Let me make some comments on your messages and some of the replies.

First, there is clearly a need for a service which is more attribute
oriented, to provide "searchability" and "guessability".  I am very
interested in this problem.

Second, if you do not yet have a copy of X.500/DIS 9594, you should get one
as a VERY high priority.   

The X.500 stuff is important, and I believe that it should be the basis for
any service of this kind - unless there are some very fundamental problems
of your requirements which cannot be met with an X.500 solution.  This
should clearly not preclude experiments with other structures, but this is
not the time to introduce non-standard services!

There is a little confusion in the messages between X.400 and X.500.
X.400(84) introduced the attribute structured O/R Address, which for
pragmatic reasons has nasty things such as Administrative Management Domains
wired in.  The initial intention of the X.400 deesigners is that this name
form would be the basis of the Directory (X.500) Name.  In fact, there has
been a substantial (and rapid) evolution, and the X.500 structure is much
cleaner.

As noted by several of you, there are many deficiencies of X.500.  I would
suggest that most of these are not inherent.  There was a real requirement
to produce a standard for the CCITT 1988 deadline, and some aspects were
omitted.  There is substantial effort to fill the gaps over the next 2-4
years.  The important point is that the information structure, and a basic
protocol to access it have been reached.  This includes a powerful, but
controllable searching capability.  The structure gives a good balance
between being "relational" and flexible at the local level, but retaining
sufficient global structure to be implemented in an efficient way.  The
framework is defined so that it is easy for X.500 users to define their own
structures (object classes and attributes).  This makes X.500 into a good
building block.


You asked for a list of activities in this area, so let me describe the
relevant ones I know about.

There are a number of groups looking at different aspects of getting
directories into service:
  - NBS SIG 
  - EWOS (European Workshop on Open Systems - the new European profiling
  umbrella group)
  - RARE (The real European Academic Research Network, which has an active
  directory group, looking in particular at MHS and FTAM related problems.
  They will be setting up pilot services, possibly in conjunction with THORN).
  - JNT Directory Group (to organise UK AC Directory services)
  - DTI Implemtors group (ostensibly a UK implementors forum)

THORN is an Esprit project, which has a mix of Industrial and Research
partners, including UCL.   There are two current activities of interest:
 1) A pilot exercise using an ECMA TR-32 based system (an X.500 precursor),
 being done by various Research Groups (primarily in UK, France, and
 Germany).   This is in principle an open pilot, but you have to use 
 real networking (X.25 + TP0).   I will be able to provide a (short) paper 
 on this in a few days time.

 2) A development of a full X.500 system.  This will evolve into real
 procucts from the manufacturers, but should also be available to the
 research community at reasonable cost.  

UCL has also developed a lightweight X.500 system (called QUIPU), which we
are experimenting with in the context of ISODE.  I will send further
information in this in a month or two's time.    


Steve
