Mike --

Replying to your comments:

	I *know* that % is a legal character in mailbox names; that's
	why we're free to use it as we do.  Only our mailer needs to
	interpret the name with the embedded %, and we are free to
	place whatever restrictions we like on mailbox names on our own
	systems.

There are two issues here.

Yes, you (i.e., Berkeley) are certainly free to place whatever restric-
tions you like on mailbox names on your own systems.  If Berkeley wants
to stop generating "user%realhost@relayhost" return addresses, nothing
in the RFC's prohibit this.  (Though, of course, you might run into the
practical issues of non-domain hosts not being able to use these addres-
ses, as you noted.  This is something you must decide for yourselves.)

Whether a mailing list maintainer, on the other hand, can legitimately
refuse to put other sites' "user%realhost@relayhost" addresses in his
mailing list (as per Paul Mockapetris' suggestion) is another matter
altogether.

Technically, the left-hand side of an address is not to be interpreted
in any way, except by the host listed on the right-hand side.  While it
has been customary to use the "%" character for routing, this is by no
means mandatory, and if some site wants to use it in another way (as
Bob Larson suggested), no one -- under current Internet ground rules --
really has a right to say he cannot.

On the other hand, though, as far as I know no site is actually using
"%" in any way other than for routing.  And at present, unless someone
has a real reason to need to use a non-routing "%" in the LHS of an
address, I would suggest that it not be done; while it might be "inter-
esting" to see how many mailers it would break, I see no real gain to
be had in forcing the issue at the present time.
