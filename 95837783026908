Two quick points of clarification regarding this discussion.

1) All my comments regarding the relationship between X.400 and X.500
   were in the context of the naming issue. Debbie's explanation is
   exactly what I hoped was the case: X.500 is used to learn X.400 names.
   I was concerned that X.500 might be integrated too heavily with the
   message stuff.

2) I have never meant to give the impression that I believe anything 
   less than a HUGE effort has gone into X.500. Debbie's comment that
   the development of X.500 has involved a lot of "research" is probably
   the main reason for the size of the effort. It's also at the heart of
   the case I'm trying to make for our effort: Defining standards and 
   doing research don't mix very well because standards force you to make
   compromises.

At this stage, I've had a chance to see the X.500 stuff and Debbie
has had a chance to look at our stuff, and from what I see in her
message, our understanding of the relationship between the two efforts
is starting to converge.
