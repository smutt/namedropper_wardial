Having at one time owned the ".GOV" domain (defacto, not dejure) I
would like to try and take a crack at this.

The .GOV domain is supposed to be for US government organizations
(those with a "national" significance).  At the top of the .GOV tree
should be the cabinet level orgs such as Department of Justice,
Department of State, etc.  Before I left DCA, I had started the
actions to transfer policy level control of this domain to GSA.  The
person who is supposed to own this domain is Bill Ohle at GSA.  He (or
his office) should have final word on who exactly joins the .GOV
domain.

I believe texas state government should be under the TX.US domain
because it isn't part of the "national" government.  I think the
hawaii.gov domain was probably the wrong way to go.

And although you didn't ask:

For .EDU, I would restrict  registrations to institutes of higher
learning that grant 4 year degrees.  2 year schools, high schools and
grade schools should go under the .US domain.

For .COM, I would restrict registrations to those companies that have
a multi-state customer base.  All the rest should go in the .US
domain. 

I got tired one day of answering questions as to who should be
registered under .MIL so I wrote the policy down and published it.
I'm beginning to think its time to get policies in place for the
remainder of the top level domains.

Later, Mike
