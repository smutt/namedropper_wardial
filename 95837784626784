Subject &amp; Phone: IETF for DOMAIN and DNS type of service


I'm fairly new to the INTERNET so I might have missed something, but I saw the
list of IETF meetings for Austin Texas and didn't see anything about a DOMAIN
IETF meeting. Are there no more problems to deal with? I'm interested in who
is thinking about and discussing the Domain overlap/intersection/collision
between the INTERNET and ISO name space its impact on how to provide a name
server that addressses both domains. 

I have put up a name server and am trying to "munge" old code to use the
name server in lieu of old static tables.  I have multiple needs for the
name service where one class of user whishes to get immediate feed back as to
whether the request can be resolved out of the name servers current cache,
another class of user wants to get the name resolved no matter what and is
willing to wait until it gets it, and yet a third class of users who don't want
to wait for the resolution if its not in cache but still wants the name server
to effect the translation recursively if at all possible and have the user
application decide if it wants to retry for a resolution later (after the
recursive resolution by the name server has effected the resolution to now be
in cache).  Has anyone thought of a type of service argument one could pass
to the name server that would achieve this : see below

    class 1 -   Name server returns "no host/domain" indicator if not in its
                local cache

    class 2 -   Name server recursively tries (across the INternet if necessary)
                to do the resolution

    class 3 -   Name server will return "no host/domain" indicator if not in
                its local cache BUT also fires of the search to resolve the name
                /net/domain/etc. and will cache the results for later if the
                resolution is successfull. The wait or retry is up to the
                application.

    Class N  -   ???????????????


I'd appreciate any comments or information or ideas  regarding this matter.
Thanks in advance.
