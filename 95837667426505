I think this issue has been brought up before but a clarification
about the degree of importance of the TTL field was not given in the
face of problems and what those problems are. The TTL field currently
given by many name servers is very small or zero for NS records,
indicating the data or the delegation of the name space is very short
lived. It was indicated that fudging the zero TTL records by a little
bit was okay.

The question I have is the delegation of the name space is actually a
fairly long event. CMU talks to NIC and says it has three servers and
NIC says okay and delegates the CMU.EDU subdomain to the three
servers.  When is CMU going to ask for a new delegation...not that
instant...  probably not in a week or a month....maybe in 3
months...more likely after half year or so. This kind of interaction
or expectation is probably true of many other organizations like
Symbolics, BBN, Rutgers, Rice, Purdue, CSNET, etc.

In the current system, if you obey the spec, if the the delegating
server is down or a delegating server is confused then a good chunk
of the name space disappears unless you happen to have that host in
your cache and an hour or so has not gone by. This breaks alot of
systems and hurts users that can not verify that a host exists or
not...Who wants to find out many hours later after some system
programmer comes in and fixes things or whatever that they mistyped a
host name in the subdomain that had the name service problem?

Shouldn't the TTL field for delegation be a lot longer like a week
or so? Given host's don't change every hour or day and hardware
changes probably take a few hours, couldn't the TTL field be longer
then a day...maybe 12 hours or so?

Unless I am missing some subtle issue other then being able to
change data about a host quickly, the TTL field should be 25% or
50% of the expected lifetime of the information to use cached
information longer, reduce the communication overhead which for
slow links or expensive links is significant in time and/or
money and add an increased level of stability to the name service
that is as reasonable as the old host table mechanism stability.
