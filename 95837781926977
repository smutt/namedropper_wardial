I have sent the first half of this message to the bind mailing list and have
received essentially no feedback. I then realized that namedroppers might be
more interested in my questions. However, since there is significantly more
detail in this message I will send it to both mailing lists and check the
response. I promise not to flood the system after this.

Our current mail system does MAILBOX BINDING as described in RFC-883. The mail
system supports a two level hierarchy of zones (a zone for each machine and a
system wide mail zone). The system supports mail delivery to mailboxes within
a local zone, to mailboxes in other than the current zone, and to mailgroups
(any user with multiple mailboxes or specific delivery requirements is handled
as a mailgroup). Each person known outside of Yale is also represented as a
mailgroup in the mail domain which specifies local delivery for that person.
Note that there may be mailboxes and mailgroups with the same name but
belonging to different people in different zones (If necessary, names are made
unique in the mail zone by using the form lastname-firstname instead of
lastname only).

The local practice is to use lastnames for account names wherever feasible,
and mailbox names are the same as account names. In most cases the casual user
sends his mail to lastnames (or account names) and is unaware of what kind of
delivery takes place. The mail system is based on a mail data base which is
heavily munged into proper alias tables for sendmail every night. Mail delivery
is through an unadulterated version of sendmail with a relatively complex,
locally defined configuration file. There BTW exists an inverse problem here,
which is to map account names into mailgroup names in order to create proper
From: addresses (which sendmail can't do and which we handle with a frontend to
sendmail).

I am currently trying to map the functionality of our system into the
nameserver capabilities described in RFC-883. Based on my current insights I
believe that a reasonable model of mailbox binding must recognize two kinds of
bindings, bindings that will in the long run be done by the originator (but if
detected as not done yet upon receipt will be applied by the recipient host),
and bindings that will always be done at the recipient host. I make this
assumption because I believe that there will always be things about our own
systems that we don't wish to advertise (e.g. why should I tell the world all
the account names on our machine just because mailbox names happen to be the
same, I might instead have some private transformation that lets me do a final
mapping locally).

The first question about MR and MB records is therefore if the information
specified by the MR and MB records is to be used for both kinds of bindings
or only for those of the originator kind. Since the current specifications
include only information that is available world wide, I assume that the
MR and MB records are used to specify originator kind bindings only (which
may potentially be applied at the recipient host of course).
==&gt;  Question to the specifiers of RFC-883 and follow ups, is this the intended
     interpretation of the standard?

This interpretation would imply that the mailbox names used in the MR and MB
records may, assuming the proper private recipient mapping, actually be logical
mailbox names rather than real mailbox names. This would make the last-,
mailbox-, and account- name problem outlined above much more manageable.
==&gt;  Question to the specifiers of RFC-883 and follow ups, is this a fair
     interpretation of the standards?

Under the assumption that the above interpretations are correct, a question
to be asked is: Would the nameserver scheme of things be a reasonable way to
specify private bindings (the functionality needed is again some database of
mappings, although one would probably want some kind of access protection
mechanisms), or is the goal to use the good old standby of sendmail with
aliases for this (which I had hoped to get rid of once and for all)?
==&gt;  Question to the specifiers of RFC-883 and nameserver implementors, what
     would be your recommendation?

And finally, even with the above interpretations it will be necessary for the
recipient mailer to detect if an arriving message has gone through remote
mailbox binding. The problem that arises from this has only partially to do
with RFC-883, but originates with the mail delivery protocols (like SMTP).
Since they don't allow us to carry this information as part of the protocol
we must use the recipient names to recognize which addresses have gone through
remote mailbox binding. This can be achieved either by making the MB names
unique among MB and MR records in the zone (as opposed to among the entries
of a specific record type), or by using a separate zone. Using a separate zone
seems to be totally contrary to the intent of the definition of MB records.
This leaves us stuck with unique MB names over all MR and MB records, which
isn't nice either, but at least it can be done within the current framework.
==&gt;  Question to the specifiers of RFC-883 and follow ups, is this requirement
     for uniqueness among MB and MR records reasonable? Is there another rule
     which would avoid reinterpretation of an MR to MB chain (Note that
     priority of MR over MB will not do here)?

I sure would like to get some guidance on these questions. I think they are
real and need answers before we can talk about implementing mailbox binding
based on nameservers.

Thanks for any help! AG
