		    The domain system is fundamentally flawed....

	    I think this is debatable.

	Sure is.  Why does the domain system only handle zones, hosts and
	mailboxes, and poorly at that?

Because these are the only types which have been defined.  The original
definitions were meant to demonstrate a distributed replacement for
HOSTS.TXT, together with potential for extensibility (mailbox types as
defined were supposed to demonstrate this).  The types that are defined
mostly cover those things everyone absolutely needs, and hence must
implement.  There was discussion of use for mailboxes, and some have
played with it, but we haven't seen anybody feel strongly enough about
the need for a new type or types to write down a definition, with the
exception of MX (adopted) and a recent draft for "responsible person".

	Why isn't it extendable by mortals?  Why can't I name printers
	with it?  Why can't I name users with it?  There are all sorts
	of "named objects" that the domain "name" system can't "name."

If mortals want to define standard types, then why don't they step
forward with proposed definitions, and at least try for a consensus?
Mortals who have wanted to do their own things or prototype have their
own class, or use local types.  I have witnesses.  Is it that the DNS
"can't" or the DNS "doesn't have a spec for"?

We could define a new type called "self-defining ASN.1 data", with arbitrary
binary contents.  Would it help us to let everybody have their own
standard?

	Why is it so bloody expensive to update RRs because of short
	timeouts?  Why don't all site maintainers install valid
	well-known-services records?  Why aren't all site maintainers required
	to have valid well-known-services records?

These aren't new phenomena.  The service specifications in HOSTS.TXT
were about as accurate as the WKS stuff is now.  There are a lot of
people out there whose domain software has brain-damaged retransmission,
caching, etc., or whose database is bad.  There are broken mailers,
FTPs, etc., etc.  Who is funded to fix domain software or be protocol
police, domain division?  Sure, you could invent technical enforcement
means, but since a lot of our problems stem from bad implementations of
what we have, making it bigger doesn't obviously make it better.

	The list goes on and on and on and on.  My tension on this has been
	building like an earthquake.

I feel the same way, though I suspect our reasons differ.  The DNS loses
in various ways, but I can't accept 90% of the "why isn't there X"
complaints.  There is one thing that doesn't exist: a "they" stopping
anyone from doing X with the domain system.

Heading for the bunker,

paul
