What a coincidence!  I just thought of something like this yesterday.

In article &lt;11464@ditmela.oz&gt; smart@ditmela.oz.au (Robert Smart) writes:
&gt;I must be missing something. [Who said 20c in the dollar]. It seems
&gt;obvious to me that glue records are exactly like root.cache records.
&gt;In fact root.cache records are just glue records for ".". I don't
&gt;see why there is a need for glue records other than A records,
Actually, NS records in a zone deleting responsibility to a subzone
sort of fall in the same category. 

&gt;so I suggest a new sort of record
&gt;
&gt;    domain-name      IN    GLUE    192.193.194.7
Actually, they don't need to be another record type at all.  The
name server can distinguish glue RR's from regular A RR's because
the glue RR's live at or below the level of the NS RR's delegating
authority.

&gt;
&gt;These should appear in root.cache instead of A records as well as
&gt;where glue A records appear now. Glue records should be used for 
&gt;boot-strapping operations but should be otherwise ignored. They
&gt;certainly should never be passed around. 
If no other information is available, then it should be possible
to pass them out, but with a 0 TTL, otherwise the client could
get stuck.  See below.

&gt;
&gt;It might also be a good idea if, when a reply comes back with 
&gt;extraneous address records pointing to name servers then these 
&gt;should be converted from A to GLUE records. This will force us
&gt;to find the real A record for the nameserver before we can continue
&gt;but A records of name servers are likely to stay in the local cache.
If the server that we are querying has actually already done the
lookup for the real A record (or if it is actually authoritative
for the zone containing the A record), then we should be able to
cache it and use it as gospel.

&gt;
&gt;An alternative that might make transition easier would be to denote
&gt;GLUE records by a particular TTL. You have to be careful then that that
&gt;value never occurs as a real TTL.
I believe that a TTL of zero is meant for purposes such as this.
The recipient is allowed to use it once, but not hang onto it.a
Unfortunately, I believe that there are name server implementations
that do not respond kindly to 0 TTL's.

Here is how I think it should work:
	Host P.Y.Z is the name server for the Y.Z domain.

	Host Q.X.Y.Z is the name server for the X.Y.Z domain.

	The zone file for Y.Z contains an NS RR for X.Y.Z that
	points to Q, and a glue A RR for Q.

	When P starts up, it uses the glue NS and A RR's to
	query Q for Q's address and the authoritative NS RR's (Q)
	for X.Y.Z.  P installs these it its cache.

	If P receives a non-recursive query for something.X.Y.Z,
	(and it does not have the answer cached), it responds with
	a referral to the nameserver(s) for X.Y.Z.  If P received
	answers for its A and NS queries and has them cached, it
	returns these in the authority and additional sections
	of its response with the appropriate TTL.  If P does not
	have this information in its cache, then it should return
	the glue A and NS RR's with a TTL of 0.  The client would
	then query for the authoritive NS and A RR's using this
	glue.

	When P's cached information gets close to timeout, P
	should refresh it, so that other hosts that receive this
	information from P are able to keep it cached longer.

	It would be desirable if the authoritative NS information
	for X.Y.Z would be incorporated into the glue in the
	Y.Z zone file, but things don't break as badly as they
	do now if this doesn't happen.  It would be best if this
	update process could be automated.

It looks like it there would be some traffic penalty on startup
(imagine what happens when one of the root servers needs to be
restarted), but there should be a decrease in traffic due to
inconsistencies across zone boundaries.  If P is able to contact
at least one of the X.Y.Z name servers, then it will be able to
pass out the correct information about all of them.

But, how much will this break?
