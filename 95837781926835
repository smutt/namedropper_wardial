As far as I can see, the only time we would give the list of root
servers to someone else is if they make a request of us for a domain
that we don't serve.  In that case, presumably we point them back at
the root.  Is this the right thing to do?  It has always seemed odd to
me to point someone back to the root.  Presumbly they got to us from
the root.  About all we can do is cause a loop.  Shouldn't we just say
that we don't know?

I guess I am proposing that we (or Berkeley?) should make two
changes to bind:

  - if we get a query for something that we don't know about,
	we should simply say that we don't know, and not
	point back at the root

  - we should not give out information taken from our 
	initialization file.  Probably the easiest way to
	detect this is a large TTL.  I think it's better
	for us not to give it out than for other people
	to have to ignore it.

As to why we would have such information in the first place: We have
several different paths out of Rutgers.  Some of them will stay up
even if our connection to the Arpanet goes down.  Unfortunately, all
of our connections to the root servers depend upon the Arpanet.  Thus
we want hardwired pointers to name servers for sites that we can get
to when the Arpanet is down, to allow for the case where we reboot
when it is down.  We don't do this for all such sites, but for a
couple for which communications are particularly critical.  I'd like
us to be able to keep such backup information without giving it out to
others.  This backup information will include a non-standard root
node, because we have one local site that acts as a backup root server
for situations where we can't to any real one.  (It sits on a
non-Rutgers network, and has a reasonable chance of being able to get
to a real root even when the rest of the campus can't.  It has a
hacked version of bind that treats all requests as recursive.)

This suggests to me that maybe it would be useful to allow a special
value in the TTL field for backup entries.  Say 0, or -1, or "backup".
For these entries, the TTL would not be decremented, and this
information would never be given out.
