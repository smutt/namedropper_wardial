&gt; In other words if someone on the internet sends
&gt;mail to user@machine.facility.mycom.com I want the mail to be delivered
&gt;to our name server (which of course is also the primary server for
&gt;"mycom.com") and our name server will then deliver it to 
&gt;user@machine.facility.mycom.com. 

Small point of confusion here - the "mail gateway" machine and the
"name server" machine can be two separate units; it's quite easy
to decouple the two.

I'm going to sketch out a scheme that may be considered illegal
by the name service authorities, but I think it might work.  The key
to it is making the distinction between naming information available
to the internet, and name server information that's only accessible
within the local domain.

The name service that's advertised to the root for mycom.com has very 
limited MX information for mycom.com, just enough to reach the servers, eg.
	mailgw.mycom.com	in a	130.1.1.2
	mailrus.mycom.com	in a	130.1.1.3
	*.mycom.com		mx 100 mailgw.mycom.com
				mx 110 mailrus.mycom.com	
If you query about mycom.com from outside, that's all you get.

The name service that's provided within mycom.com has a full set of 
addressing and MX information that's complete and accurate.  You'd
need to run the full-scale name service on a different machine than
the name server that's advertising the public information.
Just make sure that the resolver libraries on the mail systems
internal to mycom.com don't query the name server that has
partial information, or they will be confused.

I think this would have the desired effect, namely that from the outside
all mail gets funnelled into a single server, but from inside mail
is delivered point to point directly.  

Where sendmail hacking would come in would be to provide the 
opposite arrangement, namely that all mail destined for outside
of mycom.com gets pushed off onto this mailgw service.  
As you might guess from my choice of names :-) that's what's
happening for some machines at Michigan.
