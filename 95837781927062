It seems to me that perhaps we're putting the cart before the horse
here if the argument is whether we're to maintain mailbox.domain
because dots are part of the domain name system or whether it should be
compatable with mailbox@host naming.

Are we trying to differentiate the two kinds of addresses in order to
determine whether the domain name system should be invoked or not?
E.g., we'd make some sort of MB or MR or MAILA inquiry if the mail is
addressed to brian.ucsd.edu but not if it's addressed as brian@ucsd.edu?  
That seem off-base to me!

I see the general purpose of the various mailbox binding RRs to be a way
to implement various symbolic mailbox bindings, in as general a way as
possible.  There is ample precedent in the MF/MD -&gt; MX change to realize
that perhaps we might have to change the definitions again.

I don't know of anyone actually USING the various mailbox binding RRs.
(At least, no one admitted it when I asked!)  So now is the time to
think it through THOROUGHLY and propose what we need, instead of bending
to fit the existing system.

It may be that the existing mailbox RRs are what we need, or perhaps
they're not.  Let's try to come to a consensus of what kind of mailbox
bindings, references, and so on that we need, and then see what we have
to get from the domain name system to implement those needs.
