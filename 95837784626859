The general theory has been that you get the same answer, regardless of
who asks.  A fine point is that you are allowed to order or randomize
the order of RRs in an answer, but you assume that the order will be
preserved elsewhere.  This technique has been proposed for handing out
servers, etc.

A second point is that if you hand RRs out with a TTL of zero, you could
always make it appear that an update occurred between each query for the
data.  Since no violation of the rules is visible, none occurred.

I would recommend against handing out different answers with non-zero TTLs.
They always get cached, and you always end up with curious behaviour
inspired by having two different right answers.

In the case of MX, there is an explicit rule which requires you to check
to see if you are on the list, and if so to only use closer RRs, i.e.
RRs with lower preference values.  This is similar in spirit to what you
propose, although clearly couldn't be used in a large local network to
insure that you didn't ship mail out of the local environment.  I
suspect the proper place for this is in the logic of the mail sender
which picks which MXes to use, rather than in the name server.
