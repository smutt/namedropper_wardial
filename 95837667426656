    In-reply-to: Msg of 20 Dec 1985  16:36-EST from &lt;MKL at SRI-NIC.ARPA&gt;

    I want to set the name servers for the 52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain to be
    say, PREP.AI.MIT.EDU, HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU, and GUTENBERG.AI.MIT.EDU.
    MKL@SRI-NIC won't do it, because he says that then NIC would have to
    know about the AI.MIT.EDU domain.

        OK, I was a bit confused.  I think you are too.  Here is what
        I think should be happening, and I think our IN-ADDR file
        is correct at this time.  MIT.EDU has authority over your domain
        AI.MIT.EDU.  Therefor MIT.EDU is required to know about the
        servers for AI.MIT.EDU, we are not.  In our INADDR file we
        currently have a pointer stating that for queries of net
        128.52 you should go ask the MIT.EDU servers.  Those servers
        should then tell the querier to go ask the AI.MIT.EDU servers.

        I think you should send your in-addr requests off to the
        MIT.EDU domain maintainer then...

If you had been watching television commercials lately you would
realize that if you want to buy chicken nuggets, you don't go to the
hamburger place.  Similarly, IN-ADDR.ARPA requests should go to the
IN-ADDR.ARPA maintainer, not the MIT.EDU maintainer.

We're not talking about the MIT.EDU domain.  We're talking about a
domain named IN-ADDR, which isn't even under EDU.  The fact that some
of the names in those two domains happen to represent the same
physical objects is an irrelevant (?) coincidence.

For NIC to be authoritative over 52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA requires only
that NIC be authoritative for 128.IN-ADDR.ARPA, which they are.  
NIC can directly delegate authority over the domain to PREP.AI.MIT.EDU
or whoever. I don't think there is any rule that says you can only
delegate down one level, but there is a problem in doing this.
The screw is that NIC won't have the authoritative host address of the
delgate server host in the AI.MIT.EDU domain, (but the server which is
authoritative for MIT.EDU is closer and has that answer.)

So, to get the answer for {IN,PTR,"14.22.52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA"} a user
asks NIC.  NIC can say {IN,NS,"HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU"} but doesn't know
the host address for HERMES, and can't put that in its Additional
section.  NIC can also point you to the name and address of "MIT.EDU"
domain servers, which can tell you HERMES's address, so that then you
can connect to HERMES and get the answer to your original question.

I think resolvers will wind up needing to ask the authority for
MIT.EDU some of the relavent questions anyway, since the answer lives
in a server underneath MIT.EDU and you have to find it.  You have to
decide on which search path to send them.  I don't know the optimum
configuration offhand, but I don't see any reason why it is not
possible for NIC to refer people to PREP or HERMES for IN-ADDR queries.
