	I'd like to see the host requirements RFC address the use of
TCP in the domain system.  Specifically, when (if ever) is it
appropriate for a resolver to use TCP for simple queries (for A
records, for example), and are there any "M" words governing whether
domain servers handle such queries?

	Unfortunately, the domain RFC's do not take a firm stand on
these issues, and interoperability problems result.  Consider, for
example, that:

 - IBM's VM resolver uses TCP for all queries.
 - Increasingly, UNIX applications are choosing to use TCP (the newest
   MH and gated, for example).  These TCP requests escape onto the network
   if the machine the application is running on isn't running a named
   process locally.

yet:

 - TOPS-20 domain servers refuse connections on the TCP domain port.
 - Stanford's domain servers respond to most queries that arrive on the
   TCP domain port with empty responses that have the REFUSED bit set
   in the domain header.

Since none of the above implementations are in obvious violation of any
spec, complaints to the responsible persons about lack of interoperability
tend to result in finger-pointing rather than fixes.

	What should the RFC say?  I would like to see it say that for
simple queries (ie. anything besides zone transfer), domain servers
MAY support them over TCP but that resolvers MUST use UDP when the
server is not known to support TCP.  The rationale:

 - It seems improbable that resolvers would be significantly complicated by
   a requirement that they support UDP.
 - Servers, on the other hand, may be made significantly more complicated
   if they are required to support TCP.
 - The TCP connection setup, state maintenance, and teardown is likely to
   be a significant expense to a server that receives a large number of
   TCP queries.  The server (rather than  its clients) should be able to
   make the decision about whether to incur that extra expense.
 - Similarly, the connection setup and teardown required for a TCP connection
   generally requires more packets on the network per query.
 - I have yet to hear any convincing reason why TCP would ever be superior
   to UDP for a simple query.

I am willing to turn this proposal into a paragraph or two for the RFC, but
I wanted to throw it out for discussion first since it may be controversial
and since I care more whether the RFC takes a position than I do about
exactly what that position is.

PS: The RFC may also want to say something about when it is allowable or
    appropriate for a server to set the REFUSED bit in a response.
