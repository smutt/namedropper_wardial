I installed the patch to BIND posted to this newsgroup a few weeks ago
that logs responses that contain bogus root name server information.
After perusing the logs and poking around the culprits, I have discovered
two of the ways that this misinformation is spread.

The first way is when a name server is listed as an authoritative
name server for a zone, but is not configured as one.  When another
name server queries this name server, the response will be a list
of name servers for this zone or a zone further up the tree, depending
on the contents of the misconfigured name server's cache.  If this
is an in-addr.arpa query, the response will often just be a list
of the root name servers, and if the misconfigured name server
has bogus name server RR's in its cache, it will pass them on.

The second possibility is caused when the target of a query returns
the answer to the query, but includes the root name server RR's in
the authority section.  I don't know what combination of broken
software and/or misconfiguration causes this.  I know of one host
that servers two in-addr.arpa zones that will work correctly
with one zone and not the other, and the broken/correct zones
switch around.  Names not used to protect the guilty.

I have notified the appropriate parties having the first problem,
and about half had fixed their name server configurations last
I checked.  As to the second problem...

Because of decaying TTL's, one would expect this problem to eventually
disappear, but there must be at least one name server out there that
has non-decaying TTL's for bogus root name server information and
that probably has one of the above problems, but I have not stumbled
on it directly.

I feel like I should be working for the health department.  :-)/2
