    A draft of an RFC on how Internet mailers should interact with
the domain system for the purposes of routing mail is now available
by anonymous FTP from SH.CS.NET (or CSNET-SH.ARPA) in "rfc/rfcXXX.txt".
I'll be interested in any comments that readers have.

    People should be aware that there is an anticipated change in
how the domain system stores mail routing.  MD and MF RRs are going
to be replaced by a single RR, called MX.  An MX RR matches a
domain name with two pieces of data: a domain name of a host and
a 32-bit preference number.  The preference number is used to
allow mailers to prioritize MXs. (I.e. to answer the question,
to which host should I try to deliver this message to first?).
The preference value is purely for purposes of prioritization
and has nothing to do with distances, hop counts, etc.

    There are several reasons for the change.  Here are a few:
    
    (1) It vastly simplifies what mailers have to do to route
    messages.  The decision making process turns out to be
    messy using two types of RRs.

    (2) It is more flexible than a simple two class (MD and MF)
    system.

    (3) Using one RR type instead of two dramatically reduces the
    chances for mail looping and other unpleasantness due to
    differing timeout periods for the two RR types.

The draft RFC is written in terms of using MX RRs.

    I believe that an RFC explaining this change and incorporating
the updates in DOMAIN-CHANGES.2 is planned.

----------

P.S.  For users of the BIND software, I have diffs to BIND to support
MX RRs.  It assumes that the type for MX is 15 (which was the first
free type) and that the format in the nameserver files and RRs is:

# domain        class etc.      type    host		preference
LOKI.BBN.COM.		IN	MX	UNIX.BBN.COM	10

this may well turn out to be backwards (preference could just as
well come before the host name) and the type number could prove wrong,
but at least this allows you to try things out.  Diffs are being posted to
the bind list.
