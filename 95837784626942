You can't expect Internet standards to answer every question of
network technology.  When MX is used to gateway from Internet to
another network, I don't see that the Internet standards should
specify what happens.  I think the only thing we should say is that
the host that MX points to should see to it that the mail is
delivered.  The way that the mail finally gets delivered may in some
cases have to be a kludge.  If you try to make it fit into the
standards you may tie your brain into a knot and still not solve the
problem.

Certainly having the MX host deliver mail directly to the final
destination is one safe way to solve it.  But you can hardly demand
that.  If you did, it would be impossible to forward mail out of the
Internet to any other network that uses store and forward.  I think
looking for a general solution may be hopeless.  Obviously if the
target network uses any kind of absolute address or rerouting, you're
going to have to do something to make sure that the path from the MX
host to the destination doesn't end up looping back around.  That's
going to depend upon the technology of the network.  In the UUCP case
I'd recommend that any host whose address when interpreted absolutely
points somewhere else should have a separate UUCP name.  That is,
foo.fidonet.org shouldn't get turned into a!b!c!foo.fidonet.org, but
simply into a!b!c!foo or possibly something else like a!b!c!foo.fido,
i.e. a pseudo-domain that would have meaning only to the gateway c.
There is no problem with things like a!b!c!aramis.rutgers.edu, since
if some site in the middle recognizes aramis.rutgers.edu and decides
to use a direct Internet path, the mail will go to the right place.

Things get even more interesting if fidonet mail got sent via
Internet. Let's suppose that Rutgers has a fidonet node called
rutgersfido.fidonet.org.  This would be mx'ed to handies.ucar.edu.
When handies sends it out, the obvious thing to do would be to forward
it over the Internet to a gateway machine at Rutgers with the address
still reading rutgersfido.fidonet.org.  This might even be OK.  Our
gateway machine could simply have a local entry in its named database
pointing rutgers.fidonet.org to the final destination.  However I it
might be safer for handies to rewrite the address as
rutgersfido.rutgers.edu.  The Rutgers name server would presumably MX
that to our gateway, and our gateway would then have to make
arrangements locally to do the right thing.

If site-specific rewriting is too much trouble, one could adopt my
suggestion above in a more general form: tranform foo.fidonet.org into
foo.fido at the MX site, for all foo.  This would at least prevent the
looping problem.  But this solution would have to be worked out among
fido sites, and other networks might adopt a different solution.  I
don't think this is an appropriate subject for a standard.
