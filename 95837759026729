It seems that most of the domain name servers out there are advertising
a Time To Live of 3600 (one hour) for most of their records.  New
sites are using this as an argument to make their TTL's 3600 too.

Now to me, this seems awfully short.  Most mailers on busy systems
wont even make it from one end of the retranmission queue to the
other in less than an hour.  An hour is certainly a much shorter
period of time than it usually takes to change the address of
a machine (eg several days through the NIC or through stanford's
"networks group").  Some hosts certainly aren't going to change
anything anywhere near that quickly.

It seems to me that the TTL ought to reflect the likelyhood of change
of a data item, and perhaps the time necessary to physically make
that change.  A default TTL of 12 hours seems a lot more reasonable,
and It ought to be more like 100 hours for "stationary" hosts!

What do other people think?

(this is prompted by the fact that it seems to take quite a
 long time to actually look up an address like oz.ai.mit.edu,
 given things like poorly behaving gateways in between, and
 so on...)
