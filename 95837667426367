Hi.  It seems to me that some of us still haven't understood that the
domain naming scheme is strictly a naming scheme and has nothing to do
with the routes that are actually used for data communication.  The fact
that some hosts are in one domain (say EDU) and other hosts are in another
domain (say COM) does not imply that data communicated between them has to
be routed via some sort of gateway.  Whenever hosts share a communication
scheme (that is, a protocol family like IP/TCP/SMTP) they should commuincate
directly no matter what domain names they have.

It may be that some hosts in the EDU domain use the uucp communication scheme.
The fact that these hosts are in the EDU domain does not imply that their
data communications should go through the ARPANET somehow before it goes
to a host in the UUCP domain.

I strongly believe that a host should have one name (it may have aliases and
nicknames, but it should have a single official name).  Thus, a host that uses
multiple communication schemes and participates in several communities of
interest may have to face a hard choice when selecting which domain to join.

There are several hosts that participate in 2, 3, or more of the following
communication schemes: ARPA-Internet, BITNET, MAILNET, CSNET, and UUCP. Such
hosts are not likely to choose to be in a domain named by the name of the
communication scheme (e.g., BERKELEY.UUCP, or MULTICS.MIT.MAILNET are unlikely).
So the managers of communication scheme based domains should be prepared to
include hosts with other domain names in their routing information data bases.
