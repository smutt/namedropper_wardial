In &lt;1990Aug10.152144.17260@ee.rochester.edu&gt; I asked about handling connection
requests from addresses that my nameserver can't inverse map to a hostname.

We've seen quote a lot of responses to my original post.  Its an old subject,
I know, but I wanted to hear some new perspectives on it.  I thank everyone
for sharing their point of view.  There seems not to be an objective Right
or Wrong, but rather many opinions expressed.  I quote several here -- although
edited, I have attempted to take nothing out of context.

Andrew, I hope you don't mind my quoting your mail here.  It seems directly
relevant.

I mentioned this sort of thing in my original post. Not surprisingly, I got 
the idea from uunet in the first place.

&gt; somehow, it seems to go against our grain of "be conservative in

&gt;
&gt; I have come across a lot of people who try very hard, but don't always
&gt; succeed in getting things right, or have a lot of trouble understanding
&gt; the concept.  Penalising them in this rather harsh manner seems
&gt; somewhat rude to me, and may not be quite the way to coerce people to
&gt; use the DNS, or to get them to straighten out their end of things.

&gt; I'd rather see a few sites with misconfigured inverse mappings

&gt;
&gt; Bob, I hope you aren't really so naive as to believe that inverse
&gt; mappings are somehow secure, that the mere existence in some
&gt; resolver's cache of an .IN-ADDR.ARPA record for an internet address
&gt; means that activity apparently emanating from such an address can
&gt; always be traced to the person responsible.

I dunno.  It depends on your intentions.  I'm not looking for strict
authentication, I just want to know for the most part who is on the other
end of the line.  When some sales critter calls me up and says it's
representing Yoyodyne International, I (perhaps foolishly :-) believe it.
It's at least tried to identify itself.  If it called me and asked
me all sorts of questions, and yet *refused* to identify itself (or wasn't
able), I'd be less inclined to stay on the line.

&gt; The idea that "the entire world" depends upon uunet is pretty amusing.
&gt; It bothers me that I didn't see any smileys nor any hint that they
&gt; were implied.

:-)

You just couldn't see my face from where you were sitting.  I was smiling.
I have no idea whether Bob was, too.  But a swamped or comatose uunet would
certainly affect lots of people, although I agree it would be far from the
entire world.

&gt; The "liberal ..... conservative ..." bit quoted by others
&gt; applies to datagrams and messages.  Certainly no one intends for it to
&gt; apply to authentication.

Agreed.  The quote is from RFC793, which is for TCP.  Its application
to this situation is questionable, in my opinion.

&gt;
&gt; insisting on reverse lookup gives you two things.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) It forces maintainers to put more effort into getting their DNS
&gt; system setup correctly. If they can't talk to you, and your important
&gt; enough it is a good impetus. If people can survive with the status
&gt; quo, there is no incentive to put effort into fixing broken things.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) It is not solid, but it does give you an idea where to look when
&gt; trouble happens. If you can't reverse lookup an address, then you are
&gt; really stuck. If you can reverse lookup an address, you at least have
&gt; a starting point and it means if someone is trying to mess you about,
&gt; they have to work that much harder.
&gt; 
&gt; You can't force people to register themselves, but you can make it
&gt; dammed awkward for them. From my limited experience of Internet DNS
&gt; usage, it appears to be getting more robust. Now is probably the time
&gt; to turn the screws down tighter and make people put more effort into
&gt; getting all their records straight.

&gt;
&gt; why so much cry about it?? You can patch the ftpd to ignore connections
&gt; not to be able to give an inverse mapping, or am I wrong? As far as I  know
&gt; it's an option  given  via the Makefile.

Sorry, I didn't mean to cry.. )-;

&gt; I see anonymous FTP servers that bounce connections from people
&gt; without functioning .in-addr.arpa pointer records as the rough moral
&gt; equivalent of the Rabid Rerouters (and Domain Absolutist Rabid
&gt; Rerouters etc) discussed not so long ago in comp.mail.uucp.  It's not
&gt; appropriate for everyone in the world to run them, but the presence of
&gt; a few of them in the world calls attention to the problem and are
&gt; a good thing On The Whole even though in some cases some people are
&gt; inconvenienced.

My site isn't some wonderful archive server.  If I don't allow connections
under certain circumstances, nothing monumental is lost.

&gt; 
&gt; Besides it provides a real easy touchstone on whether your in-addr
&gt; stuff is working ok, just FTP to uunet and see if you get in....

So you mean I'd actually be *helping* folks out!  I think I've been
persuaded :-)

In &lt;1990Aug10.214533.18331@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu&gt; Paul Pomes includes ftpd.c diffs:
&gt;
&gt; Here are my changes to ftpd.c (V5.28 from uunet) that implements command
&gt; logging, enhanced local access, and restricted use if the IP inverse mapping
&gt; doesn't exist.
&gt;
&gt; [diffs deleted]

This may be just the thing.  I've not decided for sure, but its likely I'll
use this scheme.  No one has said that it would be a violation of the
specifications for telnet or ftp... that was what my ear was particularly
tuned for.
