&gt;&gt; 2.	If you cannot get to NIC.DDN.MIL, ask one of the other root
&gt;&gt; 	servers.  Since the root zone doesn't change much at all, you
&gt;&gt; 	don't have much of a chance of getting even slightly out of
&gt;&gt; 	date info.

 while it is true that the root zone doesn't change all that much, the 
 top level zones (edu, com, gov, ...) do change quite often (one or more times
 a week...  roughly).  since the root servers support both the root domain and
 the top level domains, then the root servers can get out of date very quickly,
 even if the root zone itself is not out of date.

&gt; As someone who has had the occasional fortune of using a machine that
&gt; points to C.NYSER.NET, all I can say about that paragraph is "hah, hah."
&gt; Those who run root servers seem to update their zones when they feel
&gt; like it; I have personally observed one week differences between the time
&gt; a new domain appears on NIC.DDN.MIL and the time it appears on C.NYSER.NET.

 as someone who more than occasionally takes care of c.nyser.net, i'm not
 laughing.  the 'when' of updating a root domain server's zone files has
 nothing to do with whim or folly.  it has to do with one's ability to
 retrieve those files, the sizes of which range from 8k to 328k, from one
 coast to another using an old and extremely congested 56kb max infrastructure.
 provided that i can at least establish a connection, it is not uncommon
 for my ftp client to quit due to a loss or timing out of that connection.

 the task of getting the zone files from the NIC has been automated and
 runs once per day, during 'off hours'.  we are usually fairly successful
 at getting the zone files, so we are able to update our root server on the
 same day that i get the message from the NIC stating that they have updated
 their servers.  in the event that the acquisition of zone files is
 unsuccessful, then they are gotten manually, during peak hours.  this may
 take a few days, since the failure to get them via the automated way usually
 indicates that a problem exists between here and there.  this is infrequent
 however...
