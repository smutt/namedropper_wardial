Hello:

In the messages attached below are some thoughts making Network Names and
Network Numbers available through the Domain Name System.  I think it is a
good idea, and i think it can be done in a general way to make the DNS provide
information on a number of network parameters, such as "Services and Port
numbers", or "Protocols and EtherTypes".

I talked to people at the IETF and others about providing just
network number to network name translations.  We really should do
this.  I heard that some people retreive the entire host table
just so they can split out the network section.  So, here's the
proposal of work to be done:
  - Generate a file NETWORKS.TXT
    (just the networks section of HOSTS.TXT)
    This has apparently already been done (called stable??)
  - Modify the HOSTNAME server to have a command NETWORKS or something
    to retreive the list by.  This should be trivial.
  - Generate new ZONE files for the domain system.
    This is the hard part (work for MIMI?).

In order that we don't have to write new domain server code and to make
things as simple as possible, the proposal for adding stuff to the domain
name system is like this, using NICNET (192.33.33) as an example.

Add to IN-ADDR.ZONE:
  0.33.33.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.    PTR   NICNET.NETNAME.ARPA.

Add to NETNAME.ZONE:
  NICNET.NETNAME.ARPA.	       A     192.33.33.0

And likewise for all networks.  Using this scheme network names can
be looked up using the existing hostname lookup functions.  It also
keeps all the netnames undelegated and with the NIC, where they are
in the first place.

Any comments?

Subject: Re: are network names available from the DNS?

From: Paul Mockapetris &lt;pvm@venera.isi.edu&gt;

This issue has been discussed in Namedroppers and the IETF Domain
working group, and usually gets to, but not past, the following
questions:

Will this facility be used, or be another WKS or gateway list?

The DNS used network names in the IN-ADDR.ARPA tree to list advertised
gateways on networks, and used WKS to list services.  These were put in
because comparable information was available from HOSTS.TXT.  However,
because there wasn't a universal need for the information, there wasn't
a universal urge to enter and maintain the data in the database.  MX
worked because there was a clear need.  Various status programs seem to
be the intended consumers of the network name facility, and it is not
clear to some that they constitute sufficient pressure.  Of course, it
might be worth while to have a facility "on the shelf" agaianst the time
that HOSTS.TXT goes away.

Are network names supposed to be unique?  What's a legal network name?

In the DNS, the easiest way to generate unique names is to use domain
names, just as we generate host names.  However this also means that
network names start having dots in them, etc., and some object to this.
This also provides an easy route for erosion of rules, witness host
names starting with a numeric (e.g. 3com.com, 3m.com), lower case (e.g.
Berkeley vs BERKELEY), or longer than whatever the HOSTS.TXT limit is,
which are superficial to humans but does break software out there.

Who assigns network names?

Right now the NIC controls all network names, just as they control the
address space.  Some would like this to continue, others would like to
be able to name (and rename) their own networks, and feel that distributed
management is the answer.

Do we need network number=&gt;name mapping, network name=&gt;number mapping,
or both?

This is an issue if we have distributed name assignment, particularly if
network names are not domain names like host names.  Obviously the
network name to address mapping is the more difficult case.  We can do
it, but there is a cost in the form of additional tree space to define
and manage, and additional search time/complexity in queries.  This cost
varies a great deal with the rules for names.

- --------

In my opinion:

	The problem falls apart if the NIC continues to manage network names.

	If a distributed system is desired, the key issues are whether or not
	there is a real need to map network names onto numbers, and if so,
	what the characteristics of network names should be.  Its easy to say
	"yes" and "just as they are now" but this will cost a lot more than
	a more restrictive system.

==============================================================================

Mark Lottor makes three proposals (1) to make a NETWORK.TXT file, (2) to
make a NETWORKS command in the HOSTNAME server, and (3) to add network
names to the DNS in a specific way.

I think that points 1 and 2 are clear cut good things and should be done
without further discussion.

I think that point 3 (adding network names to the DNS) should be generalized
and a brief memo proposing the general mechanism be circulated for comments.
