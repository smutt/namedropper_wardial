The choices between recursive/non-recursive and TCP/UDP are supposed
to be independent.

Recursive service moves the caching and searching functions from the
client's resolver to a name server.  The two most common reason for
wanting to use recursive service are that the original client doesn't
want to provide a resolver (no code, no resources, etc.), or a bunch
of clients want to share a cache at a recursive server.

Thus the model is that when you ask for recursive service, you want back
the answer or a temporary failure, but you don't want to deal with
anything else.  Put another way, the assumption is that the client is
going to believe the response without checking it for reasonableness,
and the client wouldn't be asking for recursive service if it was
interested in which servers provided the info, etc.  Thus it seems
reasonable that the authority and additional sections of the response to
a recursive query will be ignored by the client; if the server puts
something there, its for informational or debugging purposes.

Some interaction between the choices comes from the fact that if a
client sends a recursive query via UDP, the client doesn't have any good
way of estimating a retransmission timeout, since the recursive query
can take a highly variable amount of time.  TCP solves this problem,
but if you are using recursive service because your host isn't clever,
TCP may not be a choice.  Here you just use UDP.

It seems to me that the authoritative answer bit in a recursive response
isn't likely to affect the client's action in any case, so why not just
preserve its meaning of whether the recursive server had a copy of the
relevant zone?

The action for QTYPE=* is debatable.  I believe that if the recursive
query uses a qtype such as * which matches multiple types, the recursive
server should consult an authoritative server unless it has cached
results (positive or negative) for all of the types covered by the
qtype.
