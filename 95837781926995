&gt; We've come to the conclusion here at UCSD that a few of our mailbox
&gt; handling problems can be solved by using the nameserver system on
&gt; campus as a method of maintaining and distributing a sort of global
&gt; mailbox mapping table.  Clearly something of this nature was intended
&gt; when the MAILB, MB, MR, MG, and MINFO stuff was designed into the
&gt; nameserver system.

&gt; Yet I can find no suggestions for use, nor any mention of actual
&gt; implementations of these features.  The early domain RFCs mention the
&gt; possible uses, but offer no practical suggestions nor do they really
&gt; define the semantics of each of the possible mailbox RRs.  RFC974
&gt; denies any specification too.

&gt; Is this uncharted territory?  Or have others used these RRs?


Brian,

I hope you will excuse my reply going to a larger list.

It is not uncharted territory in that people have looked at
the problem a little bit.  *BUT* the use of these RR's has not
been seriously thought through and in an application as important
as mail, I strongly urge that before anyone implement anything,
they sit down a write a document explaining the semantics and intended
uses of the RRs.

I make this plea for two reasons:

    - If everyone goes their own way, then mailers will not
    interoperate.

    - The MD/MF --&gt; MX experience (i.e. RFC974) suggests that unless
    someone sits down and figures out how to use the RRs, we may
    implement a mistake.  Only after some paper and pencil work,
    did we discover that MD/MF would cause mail-loops.  By that
    time several people had implemented MD/MF and we had to undo
    all their careful work and put in MX RRs instead.

I explicitly excluded MG/MB from RFC974 because they looked like
a harder problem than MD/MF and RFC974 started as an attempt to
standardize what people understood MD/MF to be.
