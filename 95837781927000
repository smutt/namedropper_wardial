Would it be practical to have a way to send error messages to another
server's log?  Your message asked what to do when A claims that B is
authoritative for a zone, but B claims to know nothing, or what to do
when B referes you to itself.  I have seen both of these cases, as
well as others.  Until I fixed named, what happened was you got a log
entry in your system saying 

   MAXQUERIES exceeded, probable loop in resolving &lt;name&gt;.

This is less than totally useful.  (With the fixed version, it simply
gives up, having no other paths to try.  The MAXQUERIES messages was
because the code to prevent it from trying the same thing over and
over again didn't work.)  At that point you have to break out your
manual query program and duplicate by hand the path that bind would
use in trying to resolve the query, and see if you can find out who is
giving the bogus information.  If the problem is even still there,
which of course it won't be if it is due to a bug that causes the
problem to be transient.  In practice I suspect most people didn't
bother.  And of course once bind is fixed, the messages don't show up
in the log at all.  What you really want to happen is when A claims B
is authoritative and B denies it, you send messages to both A and B
asking *them* to log the event.  The result is messages in their log
files saying:

  athos.rutgers.edu: zone njit.edu, delegated to jvnca.csc.org by sri-nic.arpa,
		      redelegated to sri-nic.arpa
  athos.rutgers.edu: zone bar.edu, delegated to foo.arpa by sri-nic.arpa,
		      redelegated circularlky

(The algorithm for detecting this is fairly simple: whenever somebody
delegates a zone, and the delegatee delegates the same zone again, you
have a problem.  You just have to make sure that the NS record that
comes back in the authority section is the same as the one you had
before.  It perfectly OK for sri-nic.arpa to delegate mit.edu to an
MIT server, and then have it delegate ai.mit.edu to a server for that
subdomain.)  The error should be reported to both parties because we
can't tell whether sri-nic.arpa delegated the zone to the wrong
server, or whether jvnca.csc.org isn't set up yet to handle
delegation.  If we report these things back to the people responsible,
then *their* disk fills up instead of mine, and maybe the right guy
takes some action.  Maybe as a general rule you should report errors
to the two servers: the one that is sending the wierd information, and
the one that delegated authority to it.  If the NIC kept getting
message of the form:

  athos.rutgers.edu: server njitsc1.njit.edu, delegated by sri-nic.arpa
		     for zone njit.edu, timed out

then eventually they would either ask for additional servers in other
parts of the country, or remove the entry in the root servers until
the name servers for the domain are functioning, as appropriate.

Actually, I'll bet we could have bind send these errors as mail
messages to postmaster@server (postmaster being the only user that is
guarantted to exist).  I'll bet that would get the domain database
cleaned up in a hurry.
