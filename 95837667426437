Larry,

I believe your intent is to gratuitously include all the domains served
by both the RICE and PURDUE servers in common, no matter which domain
was identifed in the query. Following this reasoning I would expect
NIC to return all top-level domain servers should I query for any one
of them, but that is not the case. I have no trouble with either
interpretation, since I can readily construct scenarios where either
would be more useful than the other. On the other hand, the second
scenario in my message points out the danger in assuming unjustifiable
authority. Either ISIB is authoritative and knows about the RICE.EDU
domain or it is not and so indicates in its response. The latter would
have led to a non-authoritative "unknown name" to our client, while the
former would simply have made a longer loop.

The lesson I learn from these shenannigans, beside the comment you made
about consistency checking, is that namesolvers are not nearly the simple
beasts once imagined and must claw and scratch carefully over a pretty
noisy data base. The fuzzball namesolver is getting pretty slick and is
still livable as linked with application programs, but I wonder if a
better design would have been to use a special-purpose daemon process
instead...

Dave
