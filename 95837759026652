    It would seem to me that what Bruce wants to do for THINK.COM is
entirely consistent with the naming policy that has been encouraged
on this list by the NIC.  We have been encouraged (I think correctly)
to use domain names which described our site such as SMALLU.EDU instead
of names which described type of service (e.g. SMALLU.CSNET).  The idea
was that a user who knows his colleague is at SMALLU, should not
have to figure out whether SMALLU is on CSNET or the ARPANET.

    Now Bruce suggests using an alias to free users from having to
know which of umpteen hosts he is on at THINK.COM, but simply
allow them to mail to THINK.COM directly.  Seems to me the NIC
should be praising this sort of behaviour.

craig@csnet-sh or craig@sh.cs.net (CSNET)
craig@loki.bbn.com (ARPA)

P.S.  Note that it is possible to make THINK.COM a valid name to
mail to without using CNAMEs.  One can set up an MX RR such as

THINK.COM	IN    MX	0	RELAY.THINK.COM

but this can have the unfortunate side-effect of causing mail addressed
to THINK.COM to be routed differently from mail sent directly to
RELAY.THINK.COM.  An alias doesn't have this problem.
