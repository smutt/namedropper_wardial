My nameservers lost their minds today, and I'm a seriously confused
individual trying to find out why.

I'm running BIND 4.8 on my Pyramids and BIND 4.7.3 on my Sun3/180
fileservers on behalf of their clients.  The Suns are slaves to the
Pyramids.  The Suns will be upgraded to 4.8 within the next day or so.

Late this morning, I found that named on TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU was
trying to take over a CPU, to the tune of some 60+% utilization.
Killing off and restarting named a couple of times didn't help.  I
turned on debugging for a short while and found that the problem with
Tut's named was that the Suns' named's were sending boatloads of
requests for BRL-AOS.ARPA.  So I went to an arbitrary Sun and turned
on debugging on that named, and found that it was querying for
BRL-AOS.ARPA, after which named.run announced every time, "CNAME -
more processing needed," and another query for BRL-AOS.ARPA would go
out.  Tut was responding to every one with the CNAME AOS.BRL.MIL.

I didn't know the cause, but I took a brute force approach of killing
off all Sun named's, wiping their cache with a root-servers-only
cache, and restarted them all.  Things calmed down for perhaps half an
hour, and then they all started the same song and dance again.

Since the conflict is something to do with AOS.BRL.MIL, I tried
altering my root-servers-only cache file so as to show BRL-AOS.ARPA,
just to see what it would do.  I killed/wiped/restarted all Sun
named's again, and now the world is fine.  They've been running for
over 2 hours since that last clean wipe, and all is sweetness and
light - no overload conditions, no repeated queries.

I'd like to know why the use of AOS.BRL.MIL would be causing me
trouble.  I am 95% certain that I can reproduce the situation just by
going back to a root cache file specifying AOS.BRL.MIL rather than
BRL-AOS.ARPA, so if any new data might be needed, I am sure I can get
it.  I asked around the root servers for info on BRL-AOS.ARPA and got
pretty ordinary info from everyone except AOS.BRL.MIL itself, which is
more than a little unusual.  Would anyone care to explain the presence
of 2 HINFO records, or an MX aimed at the UK?  (I stripped off the
additional info portion.)

BTW, YUMA.ARPA and BELVOIR-MAIL1.ARPA seem to have fallen off the face
of the earth in the last couple of days, according to the root
servers.  Caught me off guard for a couple mailing lists I manage.
Any reason?

Confused,
