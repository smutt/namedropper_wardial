The following is a message sent from Larry Landweber, coordinator of the
Wisconsin Gateway to ARPAnet and BITNET List Administrators.

"Because of Arpanet congestion problems, our WISCVM mail relay is unable
to keep up with the quantity of mail sent to it for forwarding. While the
problem is particularly acute in the Bitnet to Arpanet direction, the level
of traffic in both directions is a problem.  A large part of this
traffic results from mailing lists.  Furthermore, while we are usually only
sent a single copy of a list mailing, the recipient list is often very long.
A single message may require the sending of over a hundred copies &lt;over BITNET.&gt;
This is  a problem for two reasons... Arpanet congesion makes it difficult at
times to establish and keep TCP connections and such connections are slow;
second, the implementation of the gateway at present makes multiple copies
for forwarding &lt;to BITNET&gt; (a poor design choice that is being worked on).
At present, the first problem is far important.

Note that in a about a month we will begin limiting the number
of copies we will relay by putting a limit on the number of recipients
in RCPT TO lines in SMTP and BSMTP.  This limit is likely to be 10.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

Larry Landweber"

The BITNET Network Information Center has been working with Larry Landweber
on the problem discussed above.  If your Special Interest Group does
not have a BITNET site willing to create a sub-list to maintain your
BITNET subscribers, then we will assist in finding you a site.
If you have found a BITNET site to host your sub-lists, then please
send the name of your SIG and the name of the BITNET sub-list to
AKLOM@BITNIC.  This information is needed by Rich Zellich to update
the ARPANET SIGs file.  The BITNIC will coordinate the efforts of
those on the network who are working on distribution lists.  This
includes working with Rich Zellich to provide instructions
in ARPANET SIGs of where users should subscribe for each list,
helping the maintainers of the sub-lists in obtaining existing
subscriptions from the ARPAnet coordinators and contacting the SRI-NIC
to help us set up lists for the ARPAnet subscribers to BITNET lists.

These are the ARPAnet SIGs which we are aware of that have BITNET
sub-lists in operation.
