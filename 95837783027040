There are some fine points which have recently been confused about
QTYPE=ANY (or * for you non-UNIX throwbacks), QCLASS=ANY, and the use of
ANY as a CLASS.  (QTYPEs and QCLASSes are supersets of valid TYPEs and
CLASSes respectively, and appear in queries, but not in the data
returned by a query.)

-&gt; QTYPE=ANY in queries.

The only special effect that QTYPE=ANY should have in queries is that if
the QNAME points at a node with just a CNAME, the query should never be
pursued by the name server toward the canonical name.  (The same thing
happens with QTYPE=CNAME, and in general with any QTYPE which matches
CNAME.)  This allows you to ask if a name is an alias without having to
wait for data from the canonical name, and is also useful in debugging
CNAME loops, etc.

When the name is non-existent, the QTYPE is academic.  The responses
you might expect are:

*	Authoritative NXDOMAIN

	In this case, the authority section of the response may optionally
	contain a SOA.  The reason is for the transition to negative caching.
	The idea is that you are allowed to cache the fact that the name
	does not exist for the MINIMUM interval in the SOA.  In a sense,
	the SOA is a signature that says "I'm authoritative for the zone
	in question, and you are permitted to assume that the name won't
	exist fro some time.

	BIND also passes this sort of response through when it recursively
	gets such a response.  

*	Non-authoritative NXDOMAIN

	This is what a server that does negative caching is supposed to say
	when it is asked about a name that was previously found to be
	non-existent.

	There isn't a lot of this yet, because negative caching hasn't been
	widely implemented yet.  Part of the reason is that older BINDs
	react quite badly to finding the SOA signatures in the authority
	section, and we don't always output them to avoid causing hard times.

*	Non-authoritative answer, empty answer section, NS RRs in authority

	This response is from a server which is just saying that it doesn't
	know about the name, go ask somebody else.  This is what appears
	to be happening in your case.  The tipoff is the NS pointing
	at a root server.

-&gt; QCLASS=ANY

	Since there are many CLASSes and only one authority bit, the
	authority bit isn't set by servers in responses to QCLASS=ANY.

-&gt; CLASS or TYPE is never supposed to be ANY in an RR.

Part of the rationale for this is that we want zones to be for a single
CLASS.  This is a compromise.  While it would be nice to be able to set
up one RR to cover multiple CLASSes, this must be balanced against the
desire to be able to set up a new CLASS, and be free from data
"inherited" from another CLASS.  This is why ANY should not work in
master files.  Note that you can probably do what you want with includes
and duplicated data.
