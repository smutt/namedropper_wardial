Be warned: Questions with cultural ramifications.

Another warning: John Dunning, a coworker at Symbolics, has seen some
other discussion about possible ways to do some of this stuff in the
existing system.  He tried to give me 5 or more examples and I shot down
each one immediately.  Please, before submitting a way to do all of this
in the current system, make sure there aren't any counter examples.  If
you can propose a scheme, if it is complicated, it isn't worth it.

		     ------------------------------ 

A few of us at Symbolics have realized that domain names would be better
if they were explicitly rooted.  Something like A.BBN.COM has four
components (A, BBN, COM and the root) but only 2 separators.  In a
system that wants to be able (on input) to do merging and relative
naming.  On output, things are generally fully specified.  This is quite
analogous to pathnames.

Consider this example.  Assume that the default domain name is
"Quabbin.SCRC.Symbolics.COM".
 - Riverside wants to mean Riverside.SCRC.Symbolics.COM
 - White.SWW wants to mean White.SWW.Symbolics.COM
 - A.BBN.COM does &gt;&gt;not&lt;&lt; want to mean A.BBN.COM.COM

To fix the merging problem, consider one possible way to root names: put
a . at the end.  The fully specified default is now
"Quabbin.SCRC.Symbolics.COM.".  Merging works naturally.  "A.BBN.COM"
&gt;&gt;does&lt;&lt; mean "A.BBN.COM.COM." but the real name of the host is
"A.BBN.COM." which is known to be rooted.  (John Dunning tells me of a
scheme to "use dots to represent missing components."  This may work for
merging, but fails for relative naming.  Read on.)

Here comes more culture shock.  (There really are good reasons for
this.)  Turn it around:
	.COM.Symbolics.SCRC.Quabbin
This is very much like hierarchical pathnames (and isn't too much of a
culture shock except in the context of the current domain naming system).

More culture shock.  (I realize there are potential problems with the
format of mail headers.  I'm thinking about that...)
	&gt;COM&gt;Symbolics&gt;SCRC&gt;Quabbin
It is still rooted.  It also has a directional character, which has a
counterpart of &lt;.  This allows relative naming.  Our current three
examples now look like this
	Riverside means &gt;COM&gt;Symbolics&gt;SCRC&gt;Riverside
	&lt;SWW&gt;White means (up one then...) &gt;COM&gt;Symbolics&gt;SWW&gt;White
	&gt;COM&gt;BBN&gt;A means &gt;COM&gt;BBN&gt;A
and additionally
	&lt;&lt;BBN&gt;A means &gt;COM&gt;BBN&gt;A
	3rd-floor&gt;Creeper means &gt;COM&gt;Symbolics&gt;SCRC&gt;3rd-floor&gt;Creeper

For compatibility, I think a current (fully specified) domain name of
x.y.z.w can be turned into &gt;w&gt;z&gt;y&gt;x and vice versa.  We could use this
during the period of transition.  (Turn on &gt; style names for one day and
see what happens, fix the bugs, wait a month, turn them on again, etc.)

I ask for your opinions from a variety of viewpoints:
 - The ideas on their own merit.  Pretend the current domain naming
   system doesn't exist.  Pretend &lt;&gt; isn't special in mail headers.
 - The ideas in the context of existing stuff.
 - The ideas as if I were going to submit an RFC in 6 to 9 months making
   very serious claims that people should consider this as part of
   functional and human interaction (face it, humans have to interact
   with computers and need to specify names) improvements to a
   distributed network database of objects.
