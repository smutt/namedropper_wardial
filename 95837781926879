It has never been clear to me how a resolver was supposed to know
the root servers (EDU, MIL, etc.).  In the current system, I see
two choices:  (1)  The root servers can be listed in an
initialization file or (2) a resolver can try some server and hope
it knows even though it is not authoritative.

(1) has the problem that the initialization file must be updated
periodically as more root servers are added.  (This seems to
happen about once a month, based on updates to NETINFO:DOMAINS.TXT
at NIC.)  This seems to violate the spirit of the domain system,
which is to have updates propagate automatically through the
system.

(2) has the problem that it may or may not work and seems to
result in infinite recursion if an unlucky server choice is made.

Therefore, it would seem reasonable to me to have root root
servers, which would be authoritative about the current root
servers.  They could probably distribute their records with long
(a week or a month) time outs, which would reduce the number of
requests they would have to handle.
