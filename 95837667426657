	Ok. I (the maintainer of the MIT.EDU namespace) have setup
the 52.128.in-addr.arpa domain as delegated to PREP.AI.MIT.EDU,
HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU and GUTENBERG.AI.MIT.EDU. I would have done
this earlier had I known that the NIC had delegated it to me.

Flame on:

Ok. some comments:

Mark:

	Chris and Chris are correct, there is no technical reason
that delegations out of the IN-ADDR domain should have any
relation to the name domains. Names are delegated based on
administrative boundaries while addresses are delegated on
physical network boundaries. It is quite common for one
administrative domain to control multiple networks and it is
occasionally the case that multiple administrative domains appear
on the same physical network.

Chris Lindblad:

	I am surprised to find out about this problem via
"Namedroppers" as opposed to via mail sent to myself or to the
"Namecallers" list [Note to non-MITers: Namecallers is a private
MIT list].  I understand your technical point, but this problem
could just as easily been solved by the action I have taken (and
you could then fight your battles while also providing the
address to name translation service) which the community could
use.

	In fact there is probably good reason why the NIC wants
administrative entities to manage their own networks rather than
have the NIC do it, namely the NIC has better things to do.
Because they manage the ROOT of all these trees, the less work
they need to do per institution, the better.

	"This sounds like the wrong thing, because I'm not about
	to give up without a fight authority over the IN-ADDR
	domain corresponding to the network number assigned to
	the MIT AI lab to an entity that is not the MIT AI lab."
	...

Last time I checked the MIT AI lab was part of MIT, have you seceded?
