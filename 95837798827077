Excerpts from internet.namedroppers: 24-Oct-90 Re: Philosophical
question John Luke Mills@ucsd.edu (414)

&gt; &gt;And all mail from the domain goes out as 

&gt; &gt;From: local-part@andrew.cmu.edu

&gt; How do you accomplish this reverse aliasing?  Does it require all mail
&gt; to leave via "special" machines that can change the from line from
&gt; login@machine.andrew.cmu.edu to alias@andrew.cmu.edu?

Andrew handles its mail in an unusual fashion.  All the mail composers
send mail with From: lines in the given format: the machine name doesn't
enter into it at all.  Mailboxes (as well as all personal files) are
kept in the andrew.cmu.edu AFS installation; workstations are tools by
which users authenticate to AFS and manipulate their files (including
their mail).  Thus, mail is generated as ``From:
local-part@andrew.cmu.edu'' since that's how return mail is received.

The local delivery system is AMDS, which comes in the Andrew
contribution to the X.V11R4 tape.  All of AMDS at an installation,
including the stub that runs on each workstation, recognizes
@andrew.cmu.edu (i.e. the name of a connected AFS cell) as the local
domain, and delivers mail to the in-AFS mailbox.

As it happens, mail does leave andrew.cmu.edu through a set of special
macines (workstations dedicated to use as post-office machines), but
they don't generally rewrite the From: address.

All this was incidental to the original discussion, but I hope it was of
some interest anyway.
