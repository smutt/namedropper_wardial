    The CSNET CIC has recently been beta-testing a version of MMDF II
which knows how to use MX RR's in the domain system to route Internet
mail.  We have now been running this software for about three weeks,
and while it has bugs, it is beginning to settle down.  We are now
in search of a wider class of mail problems to try it with.  As part
of this experiment, we have rigged our test and development host,
DEV.CS.NET (128.89.0.94 and 8.5.0.14) to act as a mail relay.  People
who want to try mailing to domain hosts and seeing how MX's work can
deliver mail to DEV.CS.NET via SMTP and see what happens.  Let us know
(long@sh.cs.net and craig@sh.cs.net) if you find some behaviour
disturbing/startling/etc.  Please note that this is an experimental
service -- we make no promises that your mail will get through or that
DEV.CS.NET will be continuously available.  It is a development host and
we do take it down frequently to change software and hardware.  Also,
we do ask that people do *not* start sending their MX-needy mail
to RELAY.CS.NET (aka CSNET-RELAY) or other CSNET CIC hosts.  We
can't take the extra volume!

    More generally, a few comments on MX experience so far may be of
interest.  Our most serious initial problem was with servers (in
particular root servers) that didn't know about MX and returned
format errors to queries for MX RRs.  Paul Mockapetris was good enough
to get MX-understanding servers up on ISIC and ISIB after which we were
able to do serious testing.  After that we discovered a lot of problems
with timeouts.  Hosts with different network connectivity (not surprisingly)
turn out to experience noticeably different performance when querying the
domain system.  Finding good, generally serviceable, timeout periods proves
difficult.  In particular incoming SMTP mail is dramatically affected:
too short a timeout and you end up refusing most messages because you
can't resolve the sending host name (frequently they work the second
time because your local resolver cache has finally picked up the reply
from the first query issued on the first connection);  too long a timeout
and the remote host times out and concludes you are down.
