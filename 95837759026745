Fellow namedroppers:


For many months now, I've been watching the discussions on how a
user will want to address another user.  So far I have not seen
the REAL answer.  Here is the REAL answer:

    The user wants to address mail to CERF@D.ISI.EDU by
    typing:

    		CERF

    The user wants to address mail to JSmith@B.Mktg.MyCo.MyConglomerate.COM
    by typing:

		JOE

    The user wants to address mail to NewVP@B.Mktg.MyCo.MyConglomerate.COM
    by typing:

		NewVP@RugRow

In order to let the user do this, there will be PROGRAMS.  Programs
are good at dealing with arcane punctuation.

This will be accomplished by having local translation lists for both
hosts and individual mailboxes. There will be user-private lists and
system-wide lists and maybe internet-wide lists (for well-known
host nicknames like SAIL and NIC).

There will be nickname updating and verifying programs.

We need some good human-interface programs to help the user define
these translations.  The programs will let the user say: "FRED is really
FJones at the same host where JOE is."

And: "W8SDZ is the name I will use to refer to the sender of that
last message I read. Get the path out of the message and stash it."

The shorthand will be all that the user needs to use ever again, until
JOE or FRED moves, or until mail bounces for some reason.  When it bounces,
a helpful program will assist the user in straightening out the problem.


How about some discussion on these user-agent type programs and less on
punctuation?   The stuff that gets out of the local system is all
fully qualified domain structures. The dots ain't beautiful, but they
are adequate and THE USER SHOULD RARELY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM.


Just trying to clear the air...
