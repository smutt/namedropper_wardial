  I obviously did not do a good job of explaining what I meant, based on several
responses I've seen. I'll try to clarify. Firstly, if I send mail from this
machine to user@nickname, it DOES properly catch it as a local reference
and deliver it locally. I do NOT think the problem is in our sendmail.cf file.
  The real problem is the definition of "name" and "nickname" here. I'll clarify
explicitly. In the name server, we have (partial list, obviously):

@	IN	SOA	HANDIES.UCAR.EDU. WOODS.HANDIES.UCAR.EDU. (
     &lt;rest of SOA record deleted&gt;                                 )
	IN	NS	HANDIES.UCAR.EDU.
*	IN	MX	10	HANDIES.UCAR.EDU.    # wildcard MX record
ucar.edu.	IN	MX	10	HANDIES.UCAR.EDU.  # domain MX record
HANDIES	IN	A	128.117.64.4    # official A record
NCAR	IN	CNAME	HANDIES
CGDRA	IN	A	whateverthehellitis
CGDRA	IN	MX	10	HANDIES
CGDRA	IN	MX	20	CGDRA

  The idea being, of course, send to handies if it is up, otherwise send
direct to the destination host (we have dozens that look like cgdra in this
example).

  That's what I said: you can't have anything point to a CNAME. This is
just a special case of that.

&gt;You tried it and you did [get a forwarding loop], although it was only a
&gt;small loop.

   I don't think I did. Nothing above points to any CNAMEs.
&gt;
&gt;What sendmail does inside is this: It gets all the MX records for the
&gt;target name.  It checks to see if one of those records points to the
&gt;local host.  If one points to a nickname of the local host the fact is
&gt;not discovered.  If one does point to the local host (by its canonical
&gt;name) then all MX records with an equal or higher preference are
&gt;discarded.

   So far, so good. Nothing you said here is violated by the above entries,
as far as I can see. What I think is the problem is that sendmail and BIND
are using different definitions of "the local host" and "nickname of the
local host", which is causing my problem. It appears from the name server
entry above that one of the MX records DOES point to the local host. And if
sendmail realized that, BOTH of the MX records would be thrown away and it
would have to resort to using the A record, which is the behavior I want.
But, we also have this in the sendmail.cf file is this:

Dwncar
Cwncar handies

We DO have checks in the sendmail.cf file for addresses like $+@$=w (and the
fully qualified version of the same, $+@$=w.UCAR.EDU) which resolve to the
"local" mailer and work properly (if we didn't, 99% of the mail sent to
me on this machine would be bouncing). But somehow when sendmail gets back
the MX record pointing to HANDIES, it DOESN'T recognize it as the local host,
probably because the local host name has been explicitly declared to be 
something else in the sendmail.cf file. What I want is to hack sendmail
to recognize an MX record that points to ANY of the hosts defined in the
CLASS "w" to be a reference to the local host, or better still, check to see
if the official name in the "w" macro is in fact a CNAME for what the MX
record points to (as it is in this case). I suspect that to do that
is non-trivial. But since I can't have MX records point to CNAMEs it would
seem that my only other choice is to make NCAR the official name and
HANDIES the CNAME. The trouble with THAT is that the NIC has our NS record
pointing to HANDIES, and so do our backup servers and the servers for domains
that WE back up. I realize that if I do the switch, I'll have to change the
SOA record too. I'm sure bad things will happen if anything in there refers
to a CNAME. But I can't ask the NIC to change our name from HANDIES to NCAR
for reasons having to do with local politics (specifically, I'm in charge
of the name server and mail/news systems, but this machine is owned by another
group so I can't change its hostname(1) nor its entry at the NIC).
  SO, my questions were twofold: what happens if I do change the SOA record(s)
and switch the CNAME and real names of this host in our server? I don't
want to find out the hard way that this breaks everything when the domains
we back up (and our backup server people) start making irate phone calls to me.
Secondly, I wonder how hard it would be to hack sendmail to just look and
see if the Dw-defined name is in fact a CNAME for something else, and if
so, check the MX records against that instead of the CNAME.
