    So here is THE question: Are we going to find definitions for the MR, MG, and
    MB records such that meaningful implementations can be made using the current
    mail protocols, or are we first going to agree on and implement new mail
    protocols?

I'm not sure what you mean by "mail protocols."  My belief is that we
can keep the current transmission-level protocols.  Here are the steps I
see that would be necessary, and I think they can be done within the
current scope of SMTP and a modification of the semantics of "mailbox
binding" as discussed in pp 53+ of RFC 883.  Specifically:
 -  Allow another syntax as part of address requests of a mail server.  In
    addition to allowing the mailbox@maildrop syntax, also allow the
    domain-name syntax (without an @).  The mailer must be prepared to
    accept this syntax, and attach mailbox binding semantics to it.
 -  In RFC883, disassociate the foo@bar == foo.bar syntax equivalence on
    the grounds they aren't equivalent.  Therefore, one would never use
    the foo@bar syntax if one wanted mailbox binding.

Open issues: At some point the domain-name syntax needs to resolve into
a mail forwarding host and/or mail delivery host.  In fact, it may turn
into one or more mailbox@maildrop syntax destinations.  Whose
responsibility is that conversion and when does it take place?  My guess
is that mail forwarding programs should accept the non-@ syntax but
should never send the non-@ syntax.  This allows workstations to send
mail through mail forwarders without the workstation having to do the
non-@ to @ conversion.  I don't think this conversion should be done at
acceptance time, just as the maildrop needn't be verified at acceptance
time.  At least two reasons: (1) servers that could provide data for the
conversion may be down or inaccessible, and (2) it would needlessly
delay the person using the workstation.

To make this really work, people would have to be very serious about
installing and maintaining MB and MR records.  Also, mail composition
programs that normally tack on an @someplace if the person doesn't
supply one needs to be more careful about blindly changing semantics by
changing syntax.
