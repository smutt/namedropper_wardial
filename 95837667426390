Regarding Charles Hornig's message to the effect that virtually no one
on the net seemed to understand his host's new domain name:

(1) I was wondering what in the world to do with those test messages
    that bounced around here a while and wound up in our dead-letter
    file.  I'm glad I know now what was going on!  :-}

(2) I think one can realistically assume that most hosts are still using
    the NIC host name table (HOSTS.TXT) for their name-to-address trans-
    lations.  Charles's test seems to prove this assumption beyond any
    doubt.

    Since RFC921 specifies the date 15-May-85 (still in the future!) as
    a target date for programs to start using the new facilities -- and
    15-Jul-85 as a deadline by which no one should be using HOSTS.TXT
    any more -- I suppose no one can be faulted for not using the domain
    name server data base yet.

(3) I would strongly suggest that the new domain names for the various
    hosts be entered into HOSTS.TXT.  Otherwise, I don't see any reason-
    able way that a host can start using its new name, since a goodly
    (albeit hopefully decreasing over time) portion of the net will sim-
    ply not know for some time to come what in the world to do with a
    name that doesn't appear in the HOSTS.TXT file.

    I would also submit that the current official names and nicknames
    MUST also be retained in HOSTS.TXT, by the way, along with the new
    domain names.  This must be done in order to insure an orderly tran-
    sition from the old names to the new.
