Soon, I will have to bring up a couple of Suns in a subnet/department
where no Suns have gone before.  There are plenty of 4.3 bsd boxes and
VMS boxes running CMU code and we have fully operational and well
administered domain name servers.  I do not want to use any aspect of
yp that is not present in bind.  So I don't need yp. right? :-)

Sun OS as shipped does provide alternate resolver libraries for bind
services but most of the provided images are not linked with them.
Some of the programs want yp, others seem hardwired to /etc/hosts
(NFS?).  I could use the alternative image provided for sendmail to
use bind MX services if I choose.  I could trash all of the Sun utils
for the 4.3 versions... or get Sun sources and remake them with the
resolver libraries (if I was willing to put up with the release date
hysteresis).  I could hack the kernel to get NFS to try to use
resolver routines.  Yuch.

It seems that I am going to have to accept some form of yp or spend a
good part of my life trying to keep these systems working.  So, THE
questions...

How does one setup a yp domain to best co-exist with machines in a
bind environment?  Should there be correlation in the domain names
themselves?  Can a yp server be setup to use any domain names services
to keep itself more up to date?  Can they interact in ANY useful way?

Thanks in advance... I will summarize for the net if useful
suggestions are received.
