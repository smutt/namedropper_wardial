   I've just stumbled upon an interesting race involving the version
of sendmail that knows about MX records, the BIND name server, and
people who don't stick MX records in for every machine in their
domains.  This problem is illustrated by the following scenario:

	1) Sendmail makes a query to the local nameserver, asking
	for MX records for someplace (say, foo.bar.edu) that has
	no MX record.

	2) The local nameserver has no MX information on foo.bar.edu,
	so it forwards the request off to the bar.edu name server.

	3) The bar.edu nameserver sends a response with no answers,
	but that isn't an error, either.  There are some records
	in the "additional" section, but they don't matter here;
	this is a perfectly correct response to the given query.

	4) The response arrives at the local nameserver, which
	forwards it to sendmail.  But the nameserver can't cache
	an answer to this question, since no answers ever came back.

	5) Because of network delays, the phase of the moon, and other
	similar things, the response from bar.edu doesn't arrive and/or
	get forwarded before sendmail has given up and put the message
	back in the queue with a "Deferred: Host Name Lookup Failure"
	error.

	6) Since no information was cached by the local server, this
	sequence of events repeats until the network delays become
	reasonable or until sendmail completely gives up and sends
	an error message back to the user.

   It seems to me that the BIND server needs to be hacked to cache
both errors and null answers so that this sort of problem is avoided.
As far as I know, though, no one has hacked it to do this sort of
thing.  Am I missing something?
