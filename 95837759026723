The situation is deteriorating.

Paul Mockapetris mentioned some while ago that "there isn't enough pain
here to play the game right".
 
Should we only allow entries in the domain data bases that have also
primary names in the NIC hosts.txt file?
 
Can we either push the domain server/resolver issue through or should we
rather scrap the whole issue as unworkable since not every one conforms
and probably will not do so for quite some time?
 
 
Here is one story (out of a many others that happened earlier) about this:
  
Among other things I am responsible for the UMICH.EDU domain. There are two
nameservers which play the game right, are pretty up to date in their versions
and, as they should, close to different IMPs and homed in different domains.
 
Now, even though the University of Michigan is connected to the Internet
some people in our engineering department love and use their CSNET Phonenet
connection (which itself is not subject to discuss here). They would like 
to use names in the UMICH.EDU domain and asked me to put, e.g., 
EECS.UMICH.EDU in there, MX and/or A pointing to the CSNET-Relay (or 
alternatively to some host in UMICH which is connected to the Internet).
I told them that I'd put it in there but that this won't buy them a whole
lot since only fairly few people use name resolvers for outgoing mail.
Well, now I start getting complaints from sites on the Arpanet which don't
know how to get to these machines, since their names are not in their
/etc/hosts files. Face it guys, not even the home of the domain godfather
on the Arpanet resolves addresses for outgoing mail so far (well, at least
not as of a month or so ago when I tried it out). What happened was that
somehow (can we ever avoid these things) the address EECS.UMICH.EDU
appeared somewhere, without the relieving @CSNET-RELAY.ARPA (or at least
@RELAY.CS.NET) at the end. Let me point out that this does not necessarely
need to be something that happened that the CSNET-Relay machine itself.
Problem was that people then could not reply to mail, obviously. What is
CSNET up to? Is the requirement to put @CSNET-RELAY at the end until
everybody is using resolvers? Otherwise I am not sure why the push for 
CSNET sites is so hard to go for domains, since they couldn't use 
domain-only names in the interim.
 
I talked to Ken Harrenstien a while ago about the problem that if someone
puts nicknames into hosts.txt lines that some "better" mailers will replace
a nickname with the primary name. I asked him about the implications of
multiple lines in hosts.txt with the same Internet address but pointing to
different primary names. His response was that there should be a one-to-one
correlation between an Internet address and a primary name since some things
could break otherwise.
 
Thinking about these mail funnel machines (like CSNET-Relay, MIT-Multics, 
etc.) it appears that there is a requirement for multiple primary names
for the hosts that these funnels are agents for. These primary names are
needed for the interim until domain name resolvers are used for outgoing
mail in at least 95 percent of the mail originating machines. It seems that
this would only be possible if the funnel machines have as many Internet
addresses as they have hosts to serve as agents. If such a machine is
located within some Internet net something like an acceptance mask for
Internet addresses (not completely unlike subnet masks some layers down
below) could be used if this needs to be done for multiple mail destinations.
A host like CSNET-RELAY should probably allocate a whole Class B Internet
Network Number for this and suck all the traffic to this net up as if it
was destined for just the current CSNET-RELAY address, while having
multiple primary names for all these numbers in hosts.txt. Someone mentioned
to me that the acceptance of multiple IP address would require a kernel
modification in 4.2bsd systems. Has any one done this already?
 
Are there some better solutions for this, for the case that you don't want
to see %s in mail addresses? We have a very similar problem here at the
University of Michigan where we need to feed multiple non IP/TCP machines
(which understand SMTP on top of async lines and X.29/X.25 lines) with mail
from the Internet. An obvious choice here, again, would be to use a mail
agent machine, in which case we'd get the CSNET-RELAY problems locally.


I do of course realize that at least most of these problems came up and
were discussed before. On the other hand I get more and more the impression
that the distribution and use of the domain name system is stagnating at
this point of time; with a few pushers (probably mostly the BBN-CSNET folks)
and all the others waiting for all the others to complete the conversion.
I understand that at least machines at MIT and Maryland as well as
CSNET-SH, Seismo and Fuzzballs are resolving names for outgoing mail. But
what about all the others? Will something ever happen before the Milnet
decides on a conversion plan? It looks to me as if it is not quite clear
right now whether the domain name system should be completely pushed through
very soon or rather be abandoned at least for the forseeable future.
