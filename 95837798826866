I hope I'm right in reading sarcasm into this statement.  I thought we got
away from network based addresses LONG time ago.

Besides, you're mixing up two separate issues there:

The political issue:  the .UK registry (known as the NRS) registers
names the wrong way round in their forms.  I'm under .UK so I'm
OFFICIALLY registered as UK.CO.ROBOBAR (yes, in capitals :-) but I'm not
on JANET [though to be mailable from JANET, I must register an
APPLICATION-RELAY who _is_ on JANET to send me my mail -- its like an MX
-- that seems reasonable to me].

The technical issue:  the coloured book transport mechanisms officially
used on JANET uses reversed names.  That's TRANSPORT.  UUCP transport is
far worse, and yet it is possible to Get Things Nearly Right with UUCP.

It's also politically necessary for some Universities to have to provide
a user interface that accepts these backwards addresses, this is ALSO
not a real problem (see below).

The current situation is in fact only minimally sub-optimal.  NRS addresses
ARE valid Internet addresses -- The Internet domains under .UK
belong to the NRS, that is all.  And yes, Piercarlo, they _are_
Internet domains.

OK, so 99.9 % of the domains under .UK are just MX'd behind either the
nsf.ac.uk or mcsun.eu.net (like me) but that's neither here nor there.
Lots of North American domains are similarly MX'd behind uunet.uu.net,
et.  al.  What's the difference ?

&gt; and is't certainly
&gt; not Csechoslovakias fault that the UK domain scheme is backwards. It can't
&gt; be that hard for the gateways to turn the adresses around.

Simple.  The NRS scheme requires that ALL addressable hosts are
registered in the database.  The correct solution is to try the reversed
addressed address for an EXACT match in the NRS database, and if it
isn't there, then it isn't a valid NRS address, SO USE IT THE RIGHT WAY
ROUND.  Some JANET-type oughta write up an RFC for this sorta thing :-)

The heuristics are similar to those you need for matching incomplete
local addresses.  After all, a hypothetical jerry@complex.math.foo.edu
who wanted to mail freddy@gizmo.cs.foo.edu might quite reasonably say
that "mail freddy@gizmo.cs" should work as he expects, and only if
gizmo.cs.foo.edu doesn't exist does he expect the mailer to look in
Czechoslovakia.

Whether it does or not should be a LOCAL policy issue and not impinge on
the Internet at large.  I would personally prefer not to have lost the
ability to mail the REAL gizmo.CS and REQUIRE FQDNs even internally
("so set up a mail alias" would be what I'd say) but that's a *LOCAL*
policy issue.

Which way round you start off with depends on your political needs.
Some UK Universities are quite powerful enough not to need to bother, so
some of their user interfaces provide support for correctly ordered
addresses.  More cautious places may need to leave their general mail
services the wrong way round, but that's a *LOCAL* problem.

All you need to do is treat JANET as a local net with a strange
internal interface.  That's all.  Internally, JANET sites have a simple
technical solution, which only requires that they specify which
way round any particular user interface is configured.  If they ALL
just specified them the right way round, there's nothing their political
masters could do about it.  "I'm sorry sir, the sendmail.cf's come
from the USA configured like this and we don't have a mail guru who
can fix it.  We have been asking for this extra sysadmin post for a while
but budget restrictions have frozen recruitment this year."

The kludge of trying to accept addresses either way round globally
is just a bad kludge.  But it did mean that no decisions needed to be
made, I guess.  Now the kludge is starting to get strained, perhaps
someone will have to do something.  I must admit I'm glad it's not me.
