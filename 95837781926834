    I don't think we are creating any pollution at the moment, but we
    certainly might have in the past.  It took us a while to discover
    that B.ISI.EDU was no longer a root server.  Rather than swearing
    at people who are causing this problem, maybe you'd like to propose
    a way that system administrators can avoid doing so.  In particular,
      - do you have any proposal for what to put in named.cache to
    	let us find the root servers?  I don't see any alternative
    	to listing some subset of root servers.  I mean, the search
    	has to start someplace.  And I think an infinite timeout
    	makes sense too. If our root entries time out, we're sort
    	of dead in the water.

Don't put anything in the named.cache file.  Get the new version of
bind that doesn't need to have root server information in the cache at
all.  To repeat what Paul Mockapetris and I and some other people have
been saying for some time, YOU SHOULD NOT DISTRIBUTE SYNTHESIZED DATA,
IN ANY FORM, FOR ANY REASON.  Bind used to have a design bug that
required you to do this, but it doesn't anymore.

      - how are we supposed to know when the root servers change?

If you are using a list of default servers, accuracy in the boot
information is not as vital as if you are using a pre-loaded cache.
You probably do want to update the default-server list occasionally.
This is not hard, how much work is it to write a program that runs
under cron at 5AM and tells you if the list of RRs returned by a query
{QNAME=., QTYPE=NS, QCLASS=IN} has changed since yesterday?  Let's not
make a big issue out of something that could be solved with a ten
minute hack.

    Isn't there a distinction made between authoritative and
    non-authoritative data in the name server system?  I would have
    hoped that data we put in our database to "prime the pump" would
    not be considered authoritative by anybody.  We certainly don't
    put in SOA records for the root domain.  Is there a bug in bind
    or some other piece of software that makes people believe this
    sort of data?

Yeah, in theory people can always ignore cached data.  In practice
nobody does (the overloaded condition of the ARPANET backbone probably
has something to do with this).  Deciding what data to believe is
harder than it looks; part of the problem is that none of the existing
resolvers keep track of where they got a particular RR from, so
there's no cheap way to verify cached information (ie, checking the
accuracy of cached data is slightly more expensive than just ignoring
the cache completely).  There are other problems that I don't want to
go into at the moment; suffice it to say that with the current
database design the distinction between authoritative and
non-authoritative data is not as useful as one would want.


Oh, and I'd like to second Jeff Schiller's idea of just plain refusing
to cache any RR with an unreasonably long TTL.  Doing so would not
only protect the machine doing the refusing, it would help slow the
propagation of these Martian RRs.
