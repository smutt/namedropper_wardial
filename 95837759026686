In response to the message sent  23 Apr 86 14:41:19 EST (Wed) from albitz@Purdue.EDU

What you really want is some method for local names.  As you pointed out
in a previous message, the spec is silent on this issue other than to
say its a user interface problem, which I think it most properly is.
But what policy might you use?  I'd suggest the following:

If the user wants to specify a domain name exactly, end it with a dot.

When a domain name doesn't end in a dot, you try appending an ordered
list of suffixes (a search list), one by one, until it works.  The
default assumption is that the search list has a single entry, which is
just the root.  Thus in the default case typing "B.ISI.EDU" is
equivalent to "B.ISI.EDU."

Maybe we would want our list here to be (1) "." (2) "ISI.EDU."

Now there are a lot of ways to go.  The search list could be a constant
for a particular host, might be specific to a user, specific to a
user/application pair, or something else.  But this isn't a new
idea (most file system do something like this) and it seems to be
a well-understood idea that serves your purpose.

Why not CNAMEs?  

(1) The way the system works, you need a CNAME for each object
in your domains.

(2) The control here is on a domain-wide basis, and can't be selected
as a user option.

(3) The CNAMEs are like fuel rods in a reactor.  They generate some
power but you have to be really sure they don't get out into the
environment.  I can imagine the University of Kansas exporting a CNAME
with UK and Maggie getting mad at us.  I hesitate to think how many
CNAMES there would be across the Internet for "B", "OPERATOR",
"POSTMASTER" and "SUSAN".
