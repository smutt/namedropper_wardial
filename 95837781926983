    I find QTYPE=* queries useful when trying to interactively validate a domain
    to be used as a destination for mail delivery.  That way, if either the T_A
    or T_MX records are in a local cache, I'll get them, and either one is OK.
    If the QTYPE=* query doesn't get either type, my validator will ask first for
    a T_MX and then a T_A, specifically.  But the initial QTYPE=* is useful to
    get either type from the cache quickly, without having to guess which type
    is going to be present for the given destination domain.

I was completely clear what I meant, and there is also some culture
confusion on my part.

What I meant was: What good is a resolver asking a server for QTYPE=*?
What you answered (What good is an application asking a resolver for
QTYPE=*?) might also apply to my intended question.  Indeed you might
say your application doesn't care if the resolver asks a server or not,
or you might have enough control of the resolver to tell it not to
contact servers.  To which I might reply: Why not then just issue the
two T_MX and T_A requests from the local cache and if neither of them
exist then make the same requests allowing the contacting of servers.
But even then, if the MX record times out before the A record, the A
record isn't OK!

My point is, if QTYPE=* cannot supply authoritative information about
everything about the name, both positive and negative, then how useful
is it?

Part of the culture problem is modularity.  Mail delivery should ask the
system "How do I deliver to foo.bar.baz?" and that system routine would
figure it out, possibly asking the domain system.  The mail delivery
application shouldn't need to know beans about the domain system or
local implementation.  Maybe your application is modularized that way
and for brevity you left out the middle step.
