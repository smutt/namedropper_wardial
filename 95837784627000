    ... I have
    nonetheless come extremely close to making an open offer to _anyone_
    to install a trivial nameserver configuration and RFC-compliant
    sendmail setup in exchange for some flat consulting fee and root
    privileges on the system in question for one hour.  If I were actually
    to do so, I'd expect to be an extremely wealthy man by the end of next
    week.  

I doubt you'd be that rich that quick.  We're talking about the military
here -- they can't approve you as a contractor that quickly.  It would
probably be months before you'd be permitted to do the work.

	   It's not like any of these systems seems to need to do major
    NIC registration things and domain setup and all that - they just need
    to get a caching-only configuration in a nameserver, and a sendmail.cf
    that understands how to use MX records.  No sweat - I install things
    like that almost without thinking by now.

Are all the machines without resolvers Unix systems running sendmail?
That seems unlikely to me.

    Is there a good reason for no-nameserver tolerance?  Am I missing an
    important (and surely DoD-bureaucratic) justification for this
    foolishness?

Other reasons for systems without nameservers is that some sites must
run only vendor-supported software.  They can't just hire some random to
hack their mailer for them, and they can't install publically-available
software from the net.  For compatibility reasons they might still be
running an old release of the OS, and the vendor might only implement
resolving in the newer releases.

The final answer is that MILNET sites simply aren't yet required to run
resolvers.  There is a schedule of conversion to the domain system on
the Arpanet and MILNET, and according to that schedule resolvers are
still optional on MILNET.

So much for justification of their current state.  My suggestion to you
is that it's not your responsibility to make things easy for sites not
running resolvers.  While MILNET hosts aren't required to use resolvers,
they ARE encouraged to do so.  As time goes on there will be more sites
that they will have trouble reaching, and eventually the inconvenience
will motivate them to upgrade.  So, tell the people complaining to you
to leave you alone, as it's their problem and not yours.
