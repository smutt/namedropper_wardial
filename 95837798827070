    I have spent the last several days attempting to track down the source of
the bogus wildcard record that has been "infecting" name servers on the
Internet and, in particular, the name servers here at the BRL. The bogus
wildcard record causes the infected name server to return NS records for
TELECOM, NEXTSERV, and MTECV1 when queried for a non-existant top level domain,
such as "*." or "foo.", etc. One of the effects of this misinformation is a
nameserver timeout when sendmail tries to resolve an address, resulting in mail
that languishes in the queues.
    
    I started my debugging efforts with our root server aos.brl.mil. I reloaded
the name server database, verified that aos was clean, set debugging level to
16, and waited until the server had the bogus record. I found that aos received
a datagram requesting an MX record for UKW.KW (Kuwait), retrieved the NS
records for the KW domain, and forwarded the query to the first of the two
name servers (sh.cs.net and relay.cs.net). The return datagram from sh.cs.net
(192.31.103.3) contained the bogus information, which aos cached. Aos then
forwarded the query to relay.cs.net (192.31.103.4) and, eventually, received
the same bogus information. Since both servers for KW had been tried, and aos
didn't have a valid answer, an answer was sent to the originator of the MX
request with a return code of SERVFAIL. Aos was now infected and would return
the bogus information whenever queried for an NS record for a non-existant top
level domain.

    At this point, I commented out the NS records for the KW domain in the
root.zone file and reloaded the server at aos. Its been 48 hours and aos has
not been reinfected. In addition, aos has also handled queries concerning the
KW domain by sending an answer with return code NXDOMAIN. I performed the
same debugging test on vgr.brl.mil and was able to confirm the same method of
infection. However, because vgr is not a root name server, I am currently not
able to protect it from reinfection.

    I want to stress that this is in no way a claim to have discovered the
source of the problem, nor is it an attempt to point fingers at either
sh.cs.net or relay.cs.net as the cause of the bogus record. I am merely stating
the results of my efforts to find out why/where/how the nameservers at BRL are
becoming infected. Any comments or suggestions for further investigation will
be appreciated.

					Thank you,
