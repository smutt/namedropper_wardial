One thing I've been seeing more and more of these days are uses
(especially inverse queries) of the domain system I consider gratuitious
and wasteful. Here are some examples:

1. The mail system that seems to run on most DEC-10's and -20s. It
insists on being able to turn the IP address on the incoming connection
back into a host name, and if the lookup fails, it refuses altogether to
accept the mail.  At best this can cause an unnecessary delay when
transferring mail; at worst it can block mail altogether (a bogus PTR
record escaped from our server last week and it broke mail to an SRI
DEC-10 site for the entire week).  If you're worried about mail
spoofing, the proper thing to do is to include the raw IP address (in
dotted decimal form) in the mail header. A paranoid user can always
translate it back into a host name himself should he care; most won't
bother.

2. The telnet and ftp daemons on BSD UNIX.  They also insist on mapping
incoming IP addresses back into host names for inclusion in /etc/utmp
(the list of logged-in users). Again the proper approach should be to
just record the raw IP address so that anyone who is really interested
in the host name can do the translation "off line".  It is not unusual
to telnet to a heavily loaded machine, establish a TCP connection in a
few seconds or less, and then have to wait over a minute for a login
prompt to finally come back. This is silly! The situation is even worse
for hosts that do linear searches of their host tables instead of using
the domain system.

3. Various network management utilities under BSD UNIX. While most have
options to bypass name lookups (e.g., the -n option under netstat) some
do not. For example, doing a "route -f" to flush the routing table can
take ten minutes or more on a heavily loaded machine simply because
there's no way to tell it not to translate each entry into a symbolic
name as it confirms flushing it!  All utilities should also allow use of
numeric IP addresses wherever a symbolic host name would be allowed.
Most UNIX commands do, but one exception seems to be the "arp" command.

In general, I think IP address -&gt; name translations should be avoided
altogether by network daemons unless they are absolutely necessary for
"real time" authentication purposes. This is the case with, e.g., rsh
and rcp, but NOT with the regular ARPA network applications.

Comments?
