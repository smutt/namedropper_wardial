Here at the University of New Mexico we are going fully qualified
host names (because we are attaching to NSFnet).  I have several questions,
though, concerning the case of these names.

RFC 1034 (DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES) says:

	Note that while upper and lower case letters are allowed in
	domain names, no significance is attached to the case.  That
	is, two names with the same spelling but different case are
	to be treated as if identical.

and RFC 1035 (DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION) says:

	For all parts of the DNS that are part of the official
	protocol, all comparisons between character strings (e.g.,
	labels, domain names, etc.) are done in a case-insensitive
	manner.  At present, this rule is in force throughout the
	domain system without exception.  However, future additions
	beyond current usage may need to use the full binary octet
	capabilities in names, so attempts to store domain names in
	7-bit ASCII or use of special bytes to terminate labels, etc.,
	should be avoided.

If this is true, then why is it that rsh/rlogin/rcp all require
a .rhosts that EXACTLY matches the case the name server returns?
For example if I try to login from machine_a to machine_b and
machine_b's name server sees machine_a as 'machine_a.UNM.EDU', then
machine_b had better have a .rhosts that looks something like
	machine_a.UNM.EDU user
and NOT
	machine_a.unm.edu user

This question arrises from the fact that some people here at UNM
want the domain names to be in upper case, for example &lt;machine&gt;.UNM.EDU.
Our users are all going to have to be 're-educated' to use the
fully qualified names in their .rhosts.  Enough confusion is going to
be caused by the change to fully qualified names without having to explain
why they have to be in upper case.

Are there any reasons to use upper case domains names?  Are there reasons
that other institutions use upper case?  Is it because the RFC's all have
examples in upper case?

Thanks in advance
