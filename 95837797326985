&gt;	I'm getting confused by this thread.  I thought the DNS
&gt;rule was that name servers for sub-domains had to have names that
&gt;belonged to the delegating domain, and that consequently
&gt;the A records for a sub-domain server are not really glue records
&gt;in the delegating domain, since they rightly are owned by the 
&gt;delegating domain.  Yes?
No.  The owner of the NS record delegating authority for a subdomain
belongs to the subdomain.  Quoting from RFC 1034 section 4.2.1:

  The RRs that describe cuts around the bottom of the zone are NS RRs that
  name the servers for the subzones.  Since the cuts are between nodes,
  these RRs are NOT part of the authoritative data of the zone, and should
  be exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the top node of the
  subzone.  Since name servers are always associated with zone boundaries,
  NS RRs are only found at nodes which are the top node of some zone.  In
  the data that makes up a zone, NS RRs are found at the top node of the
  zone (and are authoritative) and at cuts around the bottom of the zone
  (where they are not authoritative), but never in between.

The name server that this NS record points to can be any arbitrary domain
name.  The owner of the A records for these name servers is based on
this name.  The name servers for X.Y.Z might be FOO.BAR.COM and XYZZY.EDU.
The owners of the A records for these name servers are probably the
BAR.COM and XYZZY.EDU zones.  No glue is necessary for these name servers
in the Y.Z domain because their A records do not belong to a subdomain
of Y.Z.  The only case where the Y.Z zone would be authoritative for the
A record of the name server for X.Y.Z would be if the name server was
J.Y.Z.

Also from RFC 1034 section 4.2.1:

  One of the goals of the zone structure is that any zone have all the
  data required to set up communications with the name servers for any
  subzones.  That is, parent zones have all the information needed to
  access servers for their children zones.  The NS RRs that name the
  servers for subzones are often not enough for this task since they name
  the servers, but do not give their addresses.  In particular, if the
  name of the name server is itself in the subzone, we could be faced with
  the situation where the NS RRs tell us that in order to learn a name
  server's address, we should contact the server using the address we wish
  to learn.  To fix this problem, a zone contains "glue" RRs which are not
  part of the authoritative data, and are address RRs for the servers.
  These RRs are only necessary if the name server's name is "below" the
  cut, and are only used as part of a referral response.


&gt;
&gt;	So, the server for Y.Z owns the entry for the name
&gt;server for the X.Y.Z sub-domain and is authoritative for the
&gt;address for that name server, not the server for X.Y.Z.
Nope.  The X.Y.Z domain owns the NS record for itself.  This NS
record must also be present in the Y.Z zone in order for the name
server for Y.Z to properly do the delegation.  The NS records must
match between the two zones or terrible things will happen.  The
owner of the A record for the name server is determined entirely
by the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of this host, and is
entirely independent of whether this host is a name server or not.
If the FQDN of the name server for X.Y.Z is a subdomain of Y.Z that
the Y.Z zone is not authoritative for, then the the address of this
name server must be present in the Y.Z zone file as a glue record.

&gt;
&gt;	I thought that glue records were only needed to refer
&gt;back up the tree.  In other words, the X.Y.Z server needs glue
&gt;A records to find the server for Y.Z or root.
Nope.  The X.Y.Z server should be configured with a root.cache
file or equivalent to point it at the root servers.  If it needs to
find the Y.Z server, it starts at the root and works down.

&gt;Once you find a root server, you can find any other domain server,
&gt;including the one right above you,
Right

&gt;so everyone simply uses
&gt;root glue records.
Minor quibble.  The configured in root name server information is
generally referred to as the "safety belt" (it appears that BIND just
uses this to find a root name server to query in order to find the
authoritative list of root servers, or in case this information times
out).  "Glue" information refers to those records needed to communicate
with a name server for the subdomain when that server itself resides at
or below the subdomain.

I just re-read RFCs 1034 and 1035 last week.  I picked up a lot
more the second time around.  It answered quite a few questions
that I had.  Also the section on DNS in RFC 1123 is helpful.
