Larry,

Your comments about X.500 make sense.  It is difficult to make sensible
commens on your system without having seen it!

Models: X.500 has a basic principle that there is a global/uniform space,
which should not vary with the client's location.  I suspect that your
approach is a little different.

Searching:  It is indeed up to the client to formulate the question - which
willl quite likely use filters.  Given this question, the DSAs should answer
it systematically.  There should be no need for them to compose additional
filters (as you suggest occurs in your system).

X.400 vs X.500.  Ideally, the X.400 (88) should have moved to use the new
X.500 forms.  In practice, X.400 is very heavily laden down with backward
compatability issues, and so this is not likely to happen before 1996.
The X.400(84) O/R Name is referred to as an O/R Address, and is used by the
MTS for routing.  At the UA level, an O/R Name may contain either an O/R
Address and/or a Directory Name.  This will allow the UA level to move to
X.500 (friendly naming).  

Descriptive Names:  In versions of X.500 a year or so back, names were a
much fuzzier concept.  There are big difficulties in implementing this
efficiently, and they moved back from it.  It gives particular problems for
updating information (what happens if I try to update an ambiguous name -
how can a given DSA see if it is ambiguous?).  However, there is likely to
be some move back towards descriptive naming in 92, as there are some real
benefits (e.g. guessability).

Yellow Pages vs White Pages.  I really hate this distinction - it has caused
too much argument.  My opinion is that they are really just different
aspects of the same problem.   

Research: as Debbie points out, it is hard to define what Research is in the
area of comms/distributed systems.  I think that there is a general feeling
that research is good and non-research is bad - and then defining what you
don't like to be non-research!   

"it (the RFC) will serve two useful purposes: (1) it will provide the
scientific community with an extremely valuable service.....".  My advice on
this:  DON'T DO IT.     If you want to provide services, you should use X.500.


Clearly there is the caveat, that if you are providing services which X.500
cannot, then it is OK.  However, it appears to me that the overlap is large.


Steve
