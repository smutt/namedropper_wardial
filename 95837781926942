    ....

    1. The mail system that seems to run on most DEC-10's and -20s. It
    insists on being able to turn the IP address on the incoming connection
    back into a host name, and if the lookup fails, it refuses altogether to
    accept the mail.  At best this can cause an unnecessary delay when
    transferring mail; at worst it can block mail altogether (a bogus PTR
    record escaped from our server last week and it broke mail to an SRI
    DEC-10 site for the entire week).  If you're worried about mail
    spoofing, the proper thing to do is to include the raw IP address (in
    dotted decimal form) in the mail header. A paranoid user can always
    translate it back into a host name himself should he care; most won't
    bother.

I'll answer this one, because it's my fault, sort of.

You're somewhat confused about flavors of PDP-10s.  I don't think
there's any mail system that runs on both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20;
certainly the normal TOPS-20 mailsystem doesn't, and I'm pretty sure
that's what SRI is running.  I'm also not aware of -any- domain
software for TOPS-10.  Presumably the SRI machine you are talking
about was running some derivative of the ISI TOPS-20 domain resolver
as later modified by me and some people at Stanford.  If so, it sounds
like they don't have the complete set of modifications.  The only way
that MAISER (the TOPS-20 mail listener) will outright reject a message
is if it thinks you are claiming to be it; ie, if faline is sending
mail to XX and faline claims that it's name is "xx.lcs.mit.edu", XX
will refuse to accept the mail, correctly so in my opinion.  At one
point there was a bug that could cause this behavior; I fixed it a
year ago at MIT, if SRI doesn't have it somebody there should contact
me privately and we'll get it straightened out.  The point is that
it's a bug that the vast majority of TOPS-20 machines don't have.

I can't muster much sympathy for the case of a bogus PTR RR escaping
your machine.  If you put bad data into the database you will lose,
period.  GIGO.  Likewise, I don't buy the argument that it is
antisocial for the SMTP listener to attempt to find out who it is
talking to before deciding whether or not to accept mail; in fact, as
one of the people maintaining COMSAT (the ITS mailer) I get flamed at
because the ITS SMTP listener -doesn't- scrutinize names as they come
in.  See below before you get upset at me, though.

For reasons that are now ancient history, the ISI domain resolver is
very poorly integrated with the TOPS-20 mailsystem.  This won't be an
issue for much longer, because MIT has been developing a new TOPS-20
domain resolver, which is currently in alpha test.  It'll be announced
on the appropriate mailing lists when it is ready for general
consumption.  Full mailsystem support for domains is also under
development and will also be announced when the dust settles.  In the
meantime, getting the mailsystem to work with either the ISI resolver
or the MIT resolver is a non-trivial task and not to be undertaken
without a doctor's prescription and a life insurance policy.

Sorry for the long windedness, but you're throwing rocks at one of the
few really solid programs that I've ever had the pleasure of working
on, and it doesn't deserve the abuse.  'Nuff said.

    In general, I think IP address -&gt; name translations should be avoided
    altogether by network daemons unless they are absolutely necessary for
    "real time" authentication purposes. This is the case with, e.g., rsh
    and rcp, but NOT with the regular ARPA network applications.

Good point.  Agreed (except for the last sentence), and I realize that
this is part of what you were talking about in your SRI example.
Agreed that there is a serious consistancy problem in maintaining two
parallel trees containing the same data.  This is not news, I've been
saying this to anybody who will listen for long enough that I have
heard my name used as a tag for this argument.

The main problem is one of inertia.  A lot of programs, for obvious
reasons and on a number of systems, have been minimally modified to
use the domain system the same way as they used to use host tables.
The interface used by such programs typically consists of two
functions that look as much like the old host table interface as
possible, whether you call them gethostbyname() &amp; gethostbyaddr() or
.GTHSN &amp; .GTHNS or whatever.  The third common function is something
that just gets you raw domain RRs and lets the user program sort it
out; loads of fun, that.  This was ok for the initial transition
period when the primary concern was just keeping things from
completely falling apart, but it doesn't really cut it any more.

We've ended up adding a number of new functions to the new TOPS-20
GTDOM% interface.  The key insight (obvious in retrospect) is that the
domain system is a distributed database with a single key (the name),
and that all tasks that can possibly supply a name to the user
interface should do so.  Eg, the old algorithm for authenticating the
name given in the SMTP HELO command was to take the IP address of the
network connection, translate that to a name, possibly translate
everything back and forth again to canonicalize the names, then
compare the names for equality.  Our replacement for this is a
function that takes an IP address and a name as arguments and returns
a boolean value telling you if looking up that name gets you that IP
address.  From the user's point of view it's not a serious difference,
but from the resolver code's point of view there's a world of
difference: in the first case you have to look up IN-ADDR RRs, in the
second case you don't; the second case is also fewer queries.  We
handled another case, hostname canonicalization, by having the
name-&gt;address function return the canonicalized name in addition to
the IP address.

In other words, the the changes needn't be earthshaking, but they need
to be done after careful thought.  Things that used to be quite
straightforward need to be reexamined to see if underlying assumptions
have changed.  With a few exceptions, the Internet community has been
putting this problem off until some unspecified later date.  Well,
it's later.  Welcome to the Future.
