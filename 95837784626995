                 US DOMAIN QUESTIONNAIRE FOR HOST ENTRY


To register a host in the US domain, the following information must be
sent to the US Domain Registrar (WESTINE@ISI.EDU).  Questions may be
sent by electronic mail to the above address, or by phone at (213-822-
1511).

NOTE: The key people must have electronic mailboxes.  It is also useful
for them to have NIC "handles," unique NIC database identifiers.  If you
have access to "WHOIS", please check to see if you are registered and if
so, make sure the information is current.  Include only your handle and
any changes (if any) that need to be made in your entry.  If you do not
have access to "WHOIS", please provide all the information indicated.
If you do not have a NIC ident go ahead and apply for one by sending a
message to NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA, and we will process your US domain
application in parallel.


(1)  The name of the top-level domain to join.

           For example:  US


(2)  The NIC handle of the administrative head of the organization.
     Alternately, the person's name, title, mailing address, phone
     number, organization, and network mailbox.  This is the contact
     point for administrative and policy questions about the domain.  In
     the case of a research project, this should be the principal
     investigator.

           For example:

              Administrator

                 Organization  The NetWorthy Corporation
                 Name          Penelope Q. Sassafrass
                 Title         President
                 Mail Address  The NetWorthy Corporation
                               4676 Andrews Way, Suite 100
                               Santa Clara, CA 94302-1212
                 Phone Number  (415) 123-4567
                 Net Mailbox   Sassafrass@ECHO.TNC.COM
                 NIC Handle    PQS

(3)  The NIC handle of the technical contact for the entry.
     Alternately, the person's name, title, mailing address, phone
     number, organization, and network mailbox.  This is the contact
     point for problems concerning the domain or zone, as well as for
     updating information about the domain or zone.

           For example:

              Technical Contact

                 Organization  The NetWorthy Corporation
                 Name          Ansel A. Aardvark
                 Title         Executive Director
                 Mail Address  The NetWorthy Corporation
                               4676 Andrews Way, Suite 100
                               Santa Clara, CA. 94302-1212
                 Phone Number  (415) 123-6789
                 Net Mailbox   Aardvark@ECHO.TNC.COM
                 NIC Handle    AAA2



(4)  The name of the host.  This is the name that will be used in tables
     and lists associating the domain with the domain server addresses.
     [While, from a technical standpoint, domain names can be quite long
     (programmers beware), shorter names are easier for people to cope
     with.]

           For example:  NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US

           Or:  Alpha.NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US
                Beta.NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US


(5)  If this machine is not directly on the internet, how does it
     communicate with the Internet.  Through UUCP, BITNET, CSNET, etc?
     Which forwarding host?

          For example:  The host "Networthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US" uses UUCP
          to connect to "RELAY.ISI.EDU" which is an Internet host.

          The administrator of RELAY.ISI.EDU must agree to be the
          forwarding host for Networthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US, and the
          forwarding host must know a delivery method and route to it.
          No double MXing.

(6)  Please describe your organization briefly.

     For example: The NetWorthy Corporation is a consulting
     organization of people working with UNIX and the C language in an
     electronic networking environment.  It sponsors two technical
     conferences annually and distributes a bimonthly newsletter.


(7)  What Domain Name System (DNS) Resource Records (RR) and values are
     to be entered.

     a.  A       Internet Address (internet hosts only)
     b.  HINFO   Host Information, Machine System (optional)
     c.  WKS     Well Known Services, Protocols, Ports (internet hosts only)
     d.  MX      Mail Exchanger (required for UUCP, CSNET, BITNET hosts)

     An example of RRs for an internet host.

     NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US   IN   A       128.9.3.123
                              IN   HINFO   SUN-3/11OC UNIX
                              IN   MX      10  ISI.EDU
                              IN   WKS     128.9.3.133. UDP (echo
                                                             tftp)
                              IN   WKS     128.9.3.133. TCP (telnet
                                                             ftp
                                                             tftp
                                                             finger)

     An example of RRs for a non-internet host.

     Beta.NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US   MX      10   RELAY.ISI.EDU
                                        HINFO   SUN-3/11OC UNIX



(8)  Where is the IN-ADDR pointer record to be entered. (For internet
     hosts only.)

        For example:

           123.3.9.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA.    PTR  NetWorthy.Santa-Clara.CA.US

     Who is the contact for the zone of the IN-ADDR.ARPA data, where
     this record will be entered?


(9)  What Time to Live (TTL)?  TTL is the time (in seconds) that a
     resolver will use the data it got from the domain server before it



Postel &amp; Westine                                                [Page 3]

Domain Questionnaire                                      September 1988


     asks it again for the data.  A typical TTL is One Week 604800.
     (NOTE:  TTL is not applicable to non-Internet hosts.)

        For example:

           One Week   604800


(10) CNAME Record if any.

     A nicname to official name entry

        For example:

           ANN.MDR.CA.US     CNAME     WESTINE.ISI.EDU

     NOTE:  In general CNAMES are undesirable, and usually only used
     temporarily when a host is changing from one official name to
     another.

     NOTE:  No other RRs are allowed for the name defined by a CNAME
     record.
