We are finding ourselves in a position where we have to establish a
domain naming convention for the medical community.  We expect to have
subdomains which represent a "medical center", this means a hospital
plus any associated clinics and office practices that are affiliated
with that hospital.  For example, for Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center, we expect to have host.CPMC.something.  We just aren't sure
what the "something" should be.

One possibility would be to put some of them in EDU and some in COM
and some in GOV, depending on whether it's a university hospital, a
private hospital, or the VA.  Somehow this isn't very satisfying,
because (a) I'm not sure whether CPMC is EDU or COM (they seem COM
to me, but they are sort of affiliated with Columbia University)
and (b) it doesn't tie the community together very well.  Another
possibility is to put them under a new top level domain called MED.
Yet another is to put them under a single subdomain somewhere else
in the domain tree, perhaps MED.ORG, for example.  (One way of looking
at this is that we want a place to register our customers, "our" being
AT&amp;T Medical Information Systems.  Another way is that we're looking
for a niche for the whole community, although we can't force anybody
to register in a name space that we would be administering.)  Still
another possibility is to view them as disconnected LANs that will
never talk to the outside world, or as one big medical Internet
which talks to other medical hosts but does not connect elsewhere.)
Still, I would think that someone, somewhere, would want to establish
a gateway.

This all becomes more complex when X.400 is taken into account, since
we must plan for the possibility that some day OSI will become dominant,
and then we will have little choice but to convert to it.  It would be
nice to have a naming convention that fits in reasonably will with the
X.400 global naming tree.

Any suggestions or guideance would be appreciated.
