Based on my experience on UUCP, you can fan out a lot wider than 50-100.
I've seen fanouts of 1000 with no serious problems, although beyond
that may be getting iffy.  Since the top couple levels give no idea
of what net to forward to anyway, I'm not sure that difference in fanout
buys you anything technically.  On the other hand, keeping the names
short so people won't mind typing them is important.  Which would you
rather send to: mark@cbosgd.ATT.COM, or mark@d.osg.cb.btl.att.com?
The latter describes the organizational heirarchy better, but...

I don't think EDU is going to be a problem for the domain system,
especially since only the USA seems interested in domains that don't
have their country at the top level.  (On the other hand, the minute
the University of South Carolina applies for a domain, it's going to
get interesting, and they ARE on UUCP.)  But I do have nightmares
about COM, given the number of one-man companies out there.  And that's
before every "Two-Guys-From-Italy-Pizza" starts to connect in.

For those of you who aren't familiar with X.400, the last I heard (close
to a year ago, now) they had a naming tree not that different from the
ARPA one, but with some twists.  The top level is ALWAYS the country.
The second level is ALWAYS the organization, and it goes down in
"organizational units" from there.  But you don't have names for
the nodes on the tree the way ARPA does.  Each arc is labelled with
a boolean expression of attributes.  In the simple case, you'd have

	(root)
	    \ C=US
	     X
	      \ O=ATT
	       X
		\ OU=BTL

You can imagine the blowup with all the orgs in the US right under the
same parent.  To resolve the ambiguity, you can add attributes at each
level to the boolean expression.  There are four possible attributes:
Locality, Phone number, Telex number, or Postal code (e.g. zip code.)  Thus:

			(root)
			    \ C=US
			     X
  O=ISI &amp; LOC=Marina Del Rey/ \ O=ISI &amp; LOC=San Jose
			   X   X

What is the name for the lower right X?  It's the combination of the
attributes.  There is no standard way to write this (standards committee
never thought of it) but the IFIP RFC writes it
	/C=US/O=ISI/LOC=San_Jose/
At least, until another ISI springs up in San Jose, and then you have
to add another attribute to resolve the ambiguity.  (I know of at least
four organizations in the computing field called ISI.)

I'm not trying to defend X.400, I personally think it's an abortion, but
we expect to be forced to live with it.  As you can see, putting names
under ORG works nicely with the TCP/IP world, but doesn't fit this at all.
(I'm not sure what, if anything, would fit into X.400.)
