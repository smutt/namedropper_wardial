    After reading some of the recent messages on this mailing list we
at CSNET thought it might be appropriate to tell people what we have
adopted as our policy on domain names, and how we are planning to
advise our sites.

    In essence we have decided that CSNET sites should NOT include
service related information in their domain name (like .CSNET or
CS.NET) but should instead register in the domain which
seems most appropriate (like EDU or COM).  So a CSNET site which
you now mail to as STATEU.CSNET, will become STATEU.EDU or some
such.  We are looking at ways of making this registration easy
on our members, many of whom have only nodding acquaintance with
the realities of the Internet.

    We chose to encourage sites to register in the descriptive
domain because it seemed unreasonable to expect the average mail
user to remember that an educational institition should have a name
that ends in .EDU, unless they get their mail thru CSNET (or
UUCP, etc.) in which case you must use .CSNET or .UUCP, etc.
It seemed that the whole point of domains was to get rid of this
confusion.

    There is a domain CS.NET. which is only used by the CSNET
support hosts like RELAY.CS.NET (aka CSNET-RELAY.ARPA) and
SH.CS.NET (where most of the CSNET staff actually works and
keeps their mailboxes).  This domain is now registered with
the NIC and we are in the process of getting rid of most of the
old .ARPA names (we are keeping CSNET-RELAY.ARPA and CSNET-SH.ARPA
around as CNAMES during the transition).

    One should note that there are some interesting consequences
of this decision.  First is that many if not most CSNET sites can
only be reached via RELAY.CS.NET.  They do not have Internet
addresses and the only way they participate in the Internet is
that mail can be sent to and from them via the relay.  As a result
their entries in the domain databases are simply going to be an MF
record saying send anything addressed to (for example) STATEU.EDU
to RELAY.CS.NET.  As the conversion goes into effect, people with
mailers that don't know how to cope with MF records are going to
discover that they can't reach CSNET sites.  We may try to make
this problem easier by rewriting addresses as they go thru the
RELAY to read JOE%STATEU.EDU@RELAY.CS.NET, but that seems distasteful.

    The second problem is one I've already broached with regard
to domain IL.  We've got a lot of sites out there which are gateways
into large local mailsystems.  We (and this is probably the Internet
community collectively) are going to have figure out how we want
to deal with registering all these hosts, which can only be reached
via mail.  The domain servers could be innundated with mail related
RR's and we should at least begin to think about whether there
are better solutions (like wildcarding and deferred authentication?).
