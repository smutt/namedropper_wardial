First I would like to throw a little bit of empirical evidence on the
philosophical fire here (followed by more philosophy).  All this talk
about WKS representation caused me to go look through the NIC
HOSTS.TXT table looking at services fields.  The high scorer was SAIL,
with 14 services all told (TCP and UDP).  15 bytes will only represent
up to port 120 with the bitmapping scheme.  Seems to argue for the one
byte per protocol number representation, since most hosts don't have
anywhere near this many services, even leaving out the issue of unix
semi-well-known ports.  The typical case of UDP/TFTP,UDP/NAMESERVER,
TCP/SMTP,TCP/TELNET,TCP/FTP clearly wins here, even if you make ports
two bytes instead of one byte.

Now the philosophy/religion.  People who don't like such may want to
hit their "n" keys now....

Some commonly used unix protocols would benefit from being written up
in an RFC.  Even from having the RFC shot down and having to change
the implementation.  Case in point, the lpd protocol, which is a real
pain to implement from a non unix machine because unix assumes that
the originating host is going to be calling from a low numbered port
(that being unix's idea of security).  This is a clear violation of
the normal usage of TCP.  At the same time, it really would be nice to
have a remote spooling protocol, and lpd is the best option, simply
because, as you point out, there are so many unix machines these days.
Is it that hateful to have to write up a spec?  One that complies with
the standards the rest of us use?  Obviously there are cases like uucp
where you have problems with AT&amp;T, but in most cases I don't think
that is the case.

Being a twenex hacker I will not comment on whether or not the RFC
moguls are twenex-centric (the ones here at MIT sure ain't).  You
should be aware that those of us who don't use unix have the same kind
of problems with all the "people" (nebulous) who think that if it runs
on unix that is all that matters.  In any case, your example is
broken.  Paul Mockapetris (a possibly twenex-centric RFC writer) was
also the person who wrote the twenex resolver code.  Which does in
fact do the address to name lookup, which is what I think you meant
when you said "host number to host name mapping".  He even did it
"right", ie, is using IN-ADDR to do the equivilent of gethostbyaddr().
Whereas bind (or the old version we have here anyway) does this via
IQUERY, which loses for reasons that have been discussed at great
length on this list.  I am told that this has been fixed in the latest
version of bind, but glass houses and stones and all that....
