.&gt; Consider the following topology:
.&gt; 
.&gt; 	NSFNET/INTERNET	----(expensive link)------European IP net 1 ----- The local gateway to net 1
.&gt; 	|										|
.&gt; 	|								some less expensive link
.&gt; 	|										|
.&gt; 	----(another expensive link)-----The regular gateway --- European non IP net 2---

What was happening in Australia (last time I looked) to handle this
problem was the the AU domain visible to the root servers and the AU
domain visible in Australia were different.  DNS servers of subdomains
of AU are encouraged to have a line in their named.boot forwarding
requests to the Australian gateway, so that they see the local view of
the world.  The administrator for both versions of the domain has said
he is eventually intending that the root servers should see the real
domain instead of the current fake one.  I note also that mcsun.eu.net
sees the real AU domain, not the fake one seen by the root servers. 
It's nice to get mail from Europe to Australia without dipping into
UUCP, and going through more hops, which is how uunet.uu.net gets to
Australia. 

.&gt; If we dont envisage a change in the network topology, like full European
.&gt; IP interconnection, the solution is indeed that the "european IP net 1"
.&gt; should not use the same routing information as the NSFNET/INTERNET. The
.&gt; solution used here is to supercede the MX records with local routing
.&gt; informations -- but this has clearly a high cost, as the extra info must
.&gt; be replicated to all the hosts. There are other solutions, though, like:

This use of different domain servers for remote domains is not pretty,
but it would be possible for hosts on European IP net 1 to forward
requests to some server on that net which could intercept requests for
MX records for hosts on European non IP net 2, and provide records which
point somewhere else.  Anything which didn't fit in that category would
be forwarded to the root servers.  It's not pretty, but it could work,
eh? ...  Without requiring replication of the routing information, just
a hierarchy of DNS servers which hide the parts you think are wrong. 
And it'll work without changing any software (as long as it's BIND 4.8 ;-). 

If you think it's unreasonable to do this, why do the MX records for
Australia and most European domains to point to an MX site in North
America, instead of one in Australia or Europe, e.g., mcsun.eu.net? The
only reason I can think of is that some of the links are
(unintentionally) intermittent. 

Why should mail between Australia and Europe (or between two European
countries) be diverted through uunet.uu.net or relay.cs.net? The
existing MX records provide a good service to sites in North America,
but could be improved.  I see no problem to uunet.uu.net or relay.cs.net
being a backup site (preference=100...) in case the link across the
relevant ocean were down, but I would have thought that the ideal
situation was that the MX records for sites not on the Internet should
point to the closest Internet site.  (Presumably using money, rather
than distance, as the relevant metric for closeness.)

Part of the problem is that traffic on some Internet links is
chargeable.  If this were not the case, things would be different.
And more consistent.
