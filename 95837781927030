My first reaction to recent discussion about this topic was that people
were confusing "non-authoritative" with "useless".  On reflection, I realized
that real problem is how to deal with negative information, and decided
that the "right" solution is to introduce a new feature for replies:
"negative resource records".

Consider David Plummer's scenario:

+---------------+
| Workstation   |               +---------------+
|w/ local cache |&lt;=============&gt;|               |
+---------------+               | Site resolver |
                                |      aka      |
        ...                     |Site Nameserver|&lt;===&gt; Big-I Internet
                                |               |
+---------------+       RD-&gt;    |recursion avail|
| Workstation   |&lt;=============&gt;|cache for site |
|w/ local cache |   &lt;-RA, AA?   +---------------+
+---------------+

To summarize his discussion, he asks whether the authoritative bit
should be set in responses by the site resolver to workstations
	(1) when the answer is the result of recursion
	(2) when the information comes from its cache.
He concludes that (1) should be authoritative and considers 3 answers
for case (2):
	Authoritative
	Non-authoritative
	Don't use the cache (obviously silly).

I think the solution is to realize that it isn't the information (RR's)
that is authoritative or not; rather, it is the *absence* of RR's.
That's why the authoritative bit applies to a response, not to an
individual RR.  If I send an MX query to a server and get back an
authoritative response with NOERROR but an empty answer section,
I can conclude the name has no MX records.  If the answer isn't authoritative,
I can't conclude anything about MX records.  But if I do get back RR's,
I should believe them, authoritative or not.  (The 'authority' concept was
not designed to track down and kill bogus information!)

Most cache designs, however, simply cache RR's, losing their grouping
into responses, and hence losing negative information.  There have
been various proposals lately for "negative caching", but they
haven't extended to "negative answers".

Hence my modest proposal:
Provide a way to flag a RR as being "negative", for example
	FOO.BAR.EDU MX --NONE--
(I don't really mean to use "--NONE--" as a reserved value; some other
encoding of negative RR's should be devised.)  Such entries can be
entered in a cache in response to *absence* of positive counterparts
in an authoritative response, AND CAN BE RETURNED IN ANSWERS.

In the above scenario, the site server *never* returns authoritative 
responses to the workstations (except for information about local names).
However, when it receives the first query about a name not in its cache, it
relays the query to an authoritative server, and caches both positive
and negative information.  The workstation shouldn't care that
it gets non-authoritative responses so long as it gets the information
it wants.

There remains the problem of assigning a time to live to such generated
negative RR's.  This problem as been discussed at length in this group,
and I have little to add, except to point out that if the authoritative
server returns negative RR's, it can assign appropriate TTL's as
it chooses.

Finally, this disussion also helps answer a question posed in another
message from David Plummer:  How do we convey the information that
a name does not correspond to any host?  My response is another
question:  Why would anybody care?  If I want to know whether the
name is useful as a mail destination, whether I can connect to it
via IP, or whether it is a VAX, I can look for MX, IN A, or HINFO
records, respectively.  If I want to know whether I can connect to it
at all, I have to look for class=X address rescords for all classes
I know or care about.  Wildcard queries help me find out such info
from an authoritative server without playing "twenty questions".
Negative RR's help me get such info from non-authoritative servers.
