No, Louis, you're not going crazy.  We've been bitten by this too.  I
enclose the postmortem of a problem that completely broke mail traffic
between AI.AI.MIT.EDU and Sushi.Stanford.EDU for several weeks.  This
was given local circulation (Namecallers@MC is our local domaineers'
mailing list).  I didn't think to send it to Namedroppers; maybe I
should have.  I would say that anybody still using the old version of
bind mentioned herein should be shot, except that I wouldn't want to
be on record as saying that half the unix maintainers on the Internet
should be shot (I'd have to find some other opsys to put down... :-).

    I just talked to Bill Westfield, and it may be that AI-SUSHI mail is
    now working.  SUSHI had a cache entry for the AI namespace that
    directed it to GUTENBERG, which seems to be bogus.  I don't know where
    it came from, but it's gone now, so perhaps things will continue to
    work.

Until last fall, there was no way to give bind special "out of band"
data to use to bootstrap itself into knowledge of the database.  So a
lot of records got added to local machines' initial cache load files
with godawful long timeouts (eg, 99999999 which is over three years).
Since this was in the cache, anybody who asked bind for that those RRs
(which tended to be things like SOA, NS, and A records for each zone)
stood some chance of getting the RR with the three year timeout
instead of the normal one from the zone load files.

GUTENBERG was decommissioned a month or three ago.  Bind has been
fixed to do the same thing JEEVES does (it has a special list of
bootstrap addresses).  But there are a lot of old copies of bind
around, and the damage has already been done.

Keep in mind that the domain system is a distributed database.  The
only method for invalidating a RR is having the timeout expire.  We
still have 2.5 years to go before that happens.  Short of shutting
down EVERY nameserver on the net, AT THE SAME TIME, and flushing this
RR if present, there is no way to get rid of the bugger before 1989.

Remind you of the giant tapeworm at the end of Shockwave Rider?
