&gt; I guess I'd echo part of Mike Petry's concerns about organizations
&gt; based on products or services.  But, perhaps this would warrant a .MED
&gt; space. I think what this points to is that .COM is a bit too broad in
&gt; many cases, but with the exception of .MED and .LAW, can anyone think
&gt; of lots of other top-levels that *could* be created and cause
&gt; everything to topple down?

I'd like to repeat my earlier suggestion that a formal study be made on
this question (no, I don't want the contract, I'm too busy as it is...).

To do a half-ASCII job I would scan the major headings in the telephone book,
look for a "registry of organizations" (maybe IRS has such an animal :-).

For other professions than MED and LAW, let's take a look at what kind of
professional degrees WE give out...  Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy could all
go under MED, Forestry ?!?...

If we don't think about this, something will just grow, and you know what
THAT will look like...


&gt; I do not think anyone should be concerned with one-person companies
&gt; being registered.  While "joes-eats.COM" is bothersome, there are
&gt; probably large companies that may only have one computer system on a
&gt; network and smaller companies who could grow from a one-person
&gt; operation to a large company with many systems to be addressed.

... Which will put EXTREME pressures on the maintainers of .COM to make good
guesses on the future of applicant corporations.  No, I don't think I want
that job.  Maybe IRS should do this...  [only half :-)]
