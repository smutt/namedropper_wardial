The way to think about the QTYPE=* application I mentioned is that the mail
delivery system exports a call, and that user agents that assist in mail
composition can use that call to attempt to validate the destination domain
name for outgoing mail.  (I suppose we have a ``culture problem'' insofar as
to me, ``mail delivery system'' is as low-level as transport gets.  The
``user agent'' drops off a piece of mail for delivery, to the mail delivery
system; the mail delivery system accepts responsibility for either getting
the message to its named destinations or returning it to its sender with an
error message.  Before the user agent drops off a piece of mail, it may
choose to use the exported procedure for validating a destination domain
name.)

The implementation of the destination-name-validation call, for our
particular mail delivery system, happens to be a client of the domain
resolver, which on our system is simply a library of procedures, with no
cacheing.  The only reason the call makes the QTYPE=* request of the
resolver is so that the nameserver (that is contacted by the resolver) can
return anything that has been cached.

Actually, you could be right about the QTYPE=* request, even insofar as this
application is concerned.  This application wants to check whether mail
delivery to a given destination domain name is known to be possible or
impossible.  The exported procedure does this by checking whether there are
any MX or A records for the host, and it tries to fetch any of either type
quickly with a QTYPE=* request.  Where this will fail is for a destination
domain D1 that has a single MX record pointing to host D2, and D1 has an
address record and D2 does not.  Now if the local cacheing is such that D1's
MX record has timed out but its A record hasn't, then the exported procedure
will see the A record and think that the destination is OK, whereas the
delivery system itself will find the MX pointing to D2 and then be unable to
contact domain D2.  Now, this is a pretty arcane failure; there had to be an
illegal MX record for domain D1 (a pointer to a machine that had no
address).  For that matter, the mail delivery system might in such
circumstances reasonably try to send mail directly to the address associated
with domain D1, and if the mail receiver on machine D1 doesn't know how to
cope with mail addressed directly to it, it doesn't understand the realities
of the Internet very well.
