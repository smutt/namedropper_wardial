We're in the process of writing a document specifying a recommended
standard for gatewaying between ARPA domain style addresses and
MHS (X.400) style attribute addresses.  We're trying to work with
anyone else who is interested in the same issues - if you are interested
and haven't heard from me, please drop me a line (mark@Berkeley or
mark@seismo should be properly forwarded to mark@cbosgd.ATT.UUCP.)

One issue which has come up is trying to determine how cleanly the
MHS "global naming tree" can be made to correspond to the ARPA domain
tree name space.  The two seem to have many similarities, especially
when you look at the latest proposal for the directory services.
Both have countries at the top level, and organizations right under
the countries, although there are some basic differences.  For example,
MHS elements need not be unique under their parent, rather there can
be extra attributes stuck in to resolve the ambiguities.  (For example,
if there are two "Vortex" organizations in the "US" country, both can
be directly underneath "US" in the name tree, with the same spelling,
but the sender would have to specify a geographic name, zip code,
phone number, or telex number to resolve the ambiguity.  This also
applies to subdomains ("organizational units") in a similar way.

Another difference is that the MHS stuff requires countries at the
top of the domain tree, period.  (There is some notion of having
international organizations whose names really are unique, but this
doesn't seem completely baked yet.)  ARPA allows country domains, but
it also has these extra three domains: EDU, COM, and GOV.  There are
several possible views of this from the MHS side: EDU, COM, and GOV
are organizations within US, or they are organizational units within
the ARPA org within the US, or they are three psuedo-countries which
are to be interpreted as US.  Another possibility is to declare that
the org is ARPA in the US country, and that the LHS and RHS of the
domain address are domain defined attributes (which explicitly means
the ARPA tree and the MHS tree are different.)

On the other side of the coin is how the MHS world appears from the
ARPA side.  It could be integrated as intended, in which case the two
worlds would be part of one name space (and some cooperation and
recognition of authority would be needed), or the whole thing could
be marked as part of MHS by creating an MHS top level ARPA domain
(or by using the PUB top level ARPA domain, since that one seems
intended for the public nets, ala X.25, which will almost certainly
go MHS, leaving PUB unused.)

There is a draft proposal written up, aimed at integrating X.400
and RFC920.  Since that was written I've read the directory proposal,
which is different enough that the gateway would have to be
structured differently (e.g. 2nd level domains become organizations
instead of Administration Management Domains [e.g. common carriers],
and people's names are arbitrary character strings like "John J. Smith
Jr." instead of 4-tuples of last name, first name, middle initials,
and generational qualifier.)  I can send our draft gateway proposal
to anyone interested.

In general, I'd like to invite the participation of anyone else who
is working on this issue or interested in it, so we can work together.

Very very briefly, an MHS O/R Address like
	Country	US
	ADMD	ATT
	PRMD	Foobar Inc.
	Title	Vice President
	PName	John Q. Smith
becomes, in the current proposal, in 920 syntax:
	/PName=John_Q._Smith/Title=Vice_President/PRMD=Foobar_Inc.@ATT.US
and in the directory oriented version, would be something like
	Country	US
	Org	Foobar Inc.
	Title	Vice President
	PName	John Q. Smith
becoming
	/PN=John_Q._Smith/T=Vice_President@Foobar.US
or possibly even
	/PN=John_Q._Smith/T=Vice_President/O=Foobar_Inc.@US.PUB
or
	/PN=John_Q._Smith/T=Vice_President/O=Foobar_Inc./C=US@PUB

I'm mentioning this to the list because full integration may require
ARPA to make a few changes to RFC920, like becoming more liberal about
what characters are allowed in domain names on the RHS, or restricting
what subdomains of countries can look like, so that they would fit into
the same name space as MHS.  Also, some of you may be involved with MHS
and interested in these issues.

The claim has been made that "eventually" (which means anywhere from 1
to 15 years, depending on whom you talk to) the ARPA world will have to
change to fit into the MHS world, and that MHS will become dominant,
like the post offices and telcos (and run by the same people.)  I personally
think this claim is true, but don't know what time frame to assign to it.
In any case, I hope everyone will take this seriously and learn more
about MHS.  Ignoring it won't make it go away, and it's probably very
different from what most people on this list would have designed.  (Notice,
for example, that mailing addresses are not character strings, but are
sequences of typed and tagged data, in a binary format, which I'm just
making up a printing representation for in the examples above.)
