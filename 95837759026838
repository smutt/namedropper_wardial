X.400 makes some suggestions that are relevant here; in particular, para
3.3.1 suggests that different management domains could choose different
attributes.  I believe that it suggests:
	- for commercial users: Country, organization name, organizational
	unit, (position or role, surname, and given name)
	- for residential users: Country, region, town, and street names;
	number on street; surname, given name
	- for ``architectural'' specification: country and management-domain
	names, unique number within management domain
(I parenthesized what's usually viewed in the 822 world as local-part rather
than host name.)

I believe that the evolved Arpa domain system has thus far been structured
along ``commercial'' lines: the top-level nodes (at least, the ones that are
used) are broad classifications of organizations.  But there's plenty of room
for ``residential'' machines--given, of course, someone to run domain servers
for them.  Why not ``mac-a.100.MainSt.Highland.Pittsburgh.PA.US''?  Mail
could, in principle, be delivered to the users of that machine.  And if Main
Street (or Highland Park, or Pittsburgh) got its act together, mail could be
delivered to username@MainSt.Highland.Pittsburgh.PA.US (or
username@Highland.Pittsburgh.PA.US, or username@Pittsburgh.PA.US).

The name structure of these domains seems to depend in large measure on the
decisions made by the domain authorities themselves.  We might like an
organization like the US Postal Service to provide these services for
residential customers, so that the hierarchy would resemble the residential
address structure with which we're already familiar, and particularly since
we then wouldn't have to provide the services ourselves.  But, really, why
couldn't I set up a couple of servers for, say, the PA.US domain and apply to
the NIC to be granted authority for it?  I could then put whatever I liked in
it--in particular, I could stick in stub domains like Pittsburgh.PA.US and
Highland.Pittsburgh.PA.US and myhouse.Highland.Pittsburgh.PA.US, so the
machine in my house would have an Internet-recognized name.

Just a thought.
