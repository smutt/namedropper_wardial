In an email correspondence with Piet Beertema (piet@cwi.nl) the
following explanation emerged (potentially sensitive parts elided):

                            ... . But there are indeed internal
   political problems in Germany that appear to prevent a proper
   DNS setup for DE; and Germany really isn't the only where there
   are such problems: the UK is yet another example. Main point
   is that some people still ... don't ... trust others.
   The original DSN setup came from DFN, which serves only academia;
   the "additional server" on unido is meant to serve *all* of DE
   (mainly implying that also non-Internet-connected networks served
   by EUnet will be included). And if you look at where the nameservers
   for DE are, you'll notice they're *only* in the USA; there's not
   one single secondary server in Europe!
As I read that, DFN (Deutsche Forschungs-Net?) says "We own the DE.
domain, nobody else belongs." And the NIC says "German sites must be
in the DE. domain, please register with DFN." And we get the current
mess.
   In all cases it has been offered that mcsun.eu.net run primary (for
   those countries that don't have their own server yet) or secondary
   (for those that do). Neither the Brits nor the Germans have accepted
   that (yet). ...
   The Brits have the problem that their nameservers are unreachable
   *very* often (it's the case again right now!), which clearly calls
   for the need of a secondary server (in Europe). But sofar they
   have refused to have mcsun.eu.net run secondary for UK, because
   they "have no control over it". Well, my answer to that is that
   they don't have control over their secondary aos.brl.mil either!
