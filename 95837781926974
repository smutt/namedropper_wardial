Rob,

I considered the SOA but it is a minimum for all the data not just the names.
I would expect CMU to use 1 to 3 days if we can provide a negative TTL for
names. However, I also expect us to use shorter periods of time for other
data. Obeying the specification would make us lose the relatively long
lifetime of the names.

I agree that using the SOA value is a good potential solution but I would
have us and everyone else learn about negative cacheing using a flexible
mechanism then suffer from the specification and not learn much....constantly
wishing we had a better mechanism and saying "well it will better in the
new version" -- assuming we are correct in our beliefs. If there are
interesting problems to learn about it will not happen until the new
mechanism becomes available.

Heck in the days of FTP, people added MLFL (mail file) and versions that
it notified (if logged in) and mailed or just notified (if logged in). These
features were added and provided data and the whys and why nots of doing
things like MLFL. Thanks to some experienced people we avoided MTP and
went with SMTP....which is effective and powerful and can be divorced from
the transport protocol. I am hoping that the domain system will eventually
be transport protocol independent enough that you could run it on BITNET,
JANET and other networks....
