During February I rewrote the Domain nameserver for TOPS-20 to fix some
bugs, implement MX, eliminate extra data that was causing spurious
truncation problems, prepare for the introduction of dynamic updating,
and improve its performance.  The new server was tested on ISIC for
approximately two weeks out of the month, and no problems were reported.
Since the last big change at the root servers caused problems for some
sites, I wanted to warn the list that the new server will be phased in
this month.  Its easy to tell if you are accessing the new server; it
returns MX RRs rather than MD &amp; MF.  I'd like to hear of any problems.

During the nameserver test period, some sketchy usage statistics were
compiled.  Better data will be forthcoming.  Note that these statistics
were only for ISIC, a fairly lightly loaded KL, and probably are not
representative for the usage or performance on the other root servers on
ISIB, SRI-NIC, or BRL.  Note that these statistics were only for the new
server during its test periods.

The ISIC nameserver is answering queries at the rate of approximately
one every six seconds, averaged over days, or approximately 15K/day.
The rate doesn't appear to change dramatically as a function of time of
day.

The response time of the server is measured from the time that the
server starts work on a newly delivered UDP packet to the time that it
calls the subroutine that queues the response packet for transmission,
and thus does not include network transit time, or operating system
delays.  For ISIC, the average service times was 44 milliseconds, with
53% of the service times less than 15 milliseconds and 99% less than 285
milliseconds.  Page faulting appears to be an important component of the
results; FOR THE LOADS OBSERVED, the performance of the server improved
with load because of decreased page faults.

The server recorded usage for the addresses of its first 49 clients, and
then all others lumped together.  Started at 9AM, the server filled all
50 slots sometime before 5PM.  On its first shift, BRL-SMOKE used 31%,
and two BERKELEY hosts used 10% each, with no other host or the "all
others" slot using more than 7%, and most using less than a percent.  The
"all others" slot climbed to 25% after a week.  I'm not sure what this
means other than there's more than a handfull of hosts using Domains.

Some separate measurements were also performed using a query program on
ISIC (a net 10 host) launching queries at ISIC, ISIB, SRI-NIC (on both
its net 26 and net 10 addresses) and BRL (at its various addresses).
These measurements were performed with the old nameserver on ISIC so
that the ISIB, ISIC, and SRI-NIC servers would be running identical code
(new server expected to be better).  The measurements used about 1000
queries each, and included all delays plus time for the query program to
record answers in a file.  The tests didn't address the issue of trying
alternate servers; during all runs only one root server was used.  (No
server crashed during the tests, although some were occasionally down and
couldn't be tested.)

The results varied a great deal, even between different runs to the same
nameserver.  Average per query times from 200ms (ISIC to ISIC) to 2400ms
(ISIC to BRL) were recorded for the root servers.  These numbers should be
taken with a few pounds of salt:

	1K of queries takes time, and the tests for different servers were
	not run in parallel, but in series.  Thus all comparisons had a
	certain apples and oranges flavor.

	The single worst performance observed was to ISIB, at 9PM local time,
	when the load was not heavy but file backup was running.  Average
	response time was 2900 ms for this test.

	The NIC responded better at noon than it did at 3AM for two days
	in a row, then reversed for the next three days.

	Since the query program moved on to the next query as soon as it
	got an answer, page faulting was decreased.  Inserting a 10 sec
	delay between each of the 1K queries always made results worse,
	and often produced performance curves that resembled the
	California coastline rather than inverse exponential in textbooks.

The only results that seem semi-solid rather than soupy are:

	Decrasing the retransmission interval never helped FOR THESE
	TEST CONDITIONS, and always hurt.  Within reason, the same results
	should be expected for ARPANET hosts.

	Significant packet loss only occurred with a low retransmission
	interval that overloaded per process packet queues on TOPS-20.

	From ISIC, on net 10, there wasn't a big difference between NIC
	in 26 and NIC on 10, usually 25-200 ms, averaging 100 or so.
	Given other information, this probably isn't representative.

	The best choice out of a set of candidates isn't an obvious
	function of network number or hop count.  For ISIC, the best
	ranking was ISIC (no surprise), SRI (net 10), SRI (net 26),
	ISIB, then BRL.  (Another user, who shall remain anonymous, uses
	SRI, BRL, ISIB, ISIC as order because SRI gets updates first, BRL
	runs UNIX, and ISIC runs experimental code more often.)
