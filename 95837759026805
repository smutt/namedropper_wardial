A comment on Rob Austein &lt;SRA@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU&gt;'s message:

	Another thought.  Ever gotten tired of receiving five copies of
	a message because it was (correctly) sent to five different
	lists and you happen to be one of the few people who is on more
	than one?  Happens all the time (around here, anyway).

	A good implementation of a mailer that understood MG/MB/MR RRs
	could figure all this out and send you only one copy (assuming
	of course that the data is in the domain system).

	Most mailers already do this kind of thing on a local machine
	basis (I know COMSAT and MMAILR do), it'd be a nice feature to
	be able to support on a larger scale.

I agree with Rob that elimination of duplicate delivery in the face of
overlapping mailing lists is a Good Thing.

However, remember the old question of who should get the "rejection
notice" in case an address on a mailing list is invalid.  I assume we
all agree that rejection notices should go to the list maintainer --
not the message sender (who has no control over the situation).

With regard to expanding mailing lists via MG RR's, here are a few
thoughts.  In connection with Rob's idea of merging multiple mailing
lists, particularly note my point #3 below.

(1) A mail system that does this also needs to ask for the MINFO RR for
    the list, so that it can get the "error" address.  This apparently
    needs to be done _before_ sending the message via SMTP, because the
    error address belongs in the SMTP MAIL command.

    It would do no good to wait and see if the SMTP receiver gave you an
    error during message transfer before going off to ask for the MINFO
    RR.  To be sure, if all SMTP "can't deliver mail" errors were known
    during the SMTP connection, you could get away with such a tactic.
    However, as we all know, the receiver might very possibly accept the
    message from you without complaint, and then run into an error later
    on.  If this were to happen, the receiving host could not reasonably
    be expected to do anything except to return the failed mail to what-
    ever address your mailer gave in the SMTP MAIL command (probably the
    original sender, for lack of anythying better).

(2) Since MAILB RR's really need to be acquired from the very start, I
    assert that the MAILB query type ought to be expanded to return
    MINFO RR's (in addition to MB, MG, and MR RR's).  Otherwise, you'll
    have to send out a separate request for MINFO RR's after your MAILB
    request gave you back one or more MG's -- and that's precisely the
    kind of thing QTYPE=MAILB was presumably designed to avoid.

(3) If you do merge multiple mailing lists in order to eliminate dupli-
    cate delivery, what do you do if one address appears on two or more
    different lists maintained by different people?  Which address do
    you give in the SMTP MAIL command (since you can give only one)?
