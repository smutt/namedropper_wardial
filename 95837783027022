It occurs to me as a fairly good idea to register UUCP as an
official top-level domain with the NIC as a temporary 'stop-gap'
type measure, along with willing domain name servers for this domain
using the UUCP Map data as source data for this information.
MX's would be returned to an appropriate site for any requests to the
".UUCP" top-level domain.

I could imagine sites like UUNET.UU.NET, RUTGERS.EDU, etc. as such
servers.

The need for this is fairly simple -- use USENET as an example, it
returns many "user@host.uucp" form names which need to be routed by somebody. 

What kind of administrative and working effort would have to be
made in order to accomplish this, and is it worth it?  I think it's
fairly easy, and would help for a little while longer while UUCP
sites are stuck in flatland.  The problems I see are simple:

  x  Increased interoperability between Internet and non-Internet hosts.
     (probably not a factor)
  x  Effort fixing something that some may consider isn't broken.
  x  Decreased willingness of non-Internet sites to become Internet sites.

... as a sort of example:  UUNET already offers Internet domain
name registration with UUNET.UU.NET for a fee of $35, so that
particular site may have trouble justifying free domain name serving from
UUCP Map information into the "SITE.UUCP" name space for Internet hosts.

Ideas?  Comments?  Please don't flood the comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains
newsgroup with arguments pro/con --- I've redirected followups to
comp.mail.uucp exclusively, so expand the newsgroups line only if
you have (official?) appropriate domain-relevant discussion.
