Several people have expressed confusion about the NIC's policy for
registering host nicknames, and have somehow been led to believe that
the NIC has something against second or third-level domain names.
This message is an attempt to clarify our position and explain where
the issue started.

As far as the NIC host table is concerned, there is no distinction
between a domain style name and and "old" host name; they are both
just names.  The level, or number of domains in a name, is completely
irrelevant.  The first name in a host entry is the official name which
must be used in any external references to that host.  All other names
are considered "nicknames".

In order to reduce the size of the host table, we strongly discourage
nicknames.  In general, the only valid reason for a nickname to exist
is the fact that the nickname once was, or may become, the official
name for that host.  When official names change, some period of
overlapping existence is needed to allow time for the change to
propagate to all hosts; not every site updates their copy of the host
table every night.  Thus, a more accurate term for NIC "nicknames"
would be "alternate names", since these are only intended to keep
things working, rather than to allow everyone to use their favorite
hosts on a first-name basis.  Nicknames intended for the latter purpose
are best handled locally.

There are still many old, short "first-name" nicknames which remain
for various historical reasons.  The advent of the domain name system,
with the mandatory change-over to domain-style names, is a great
opportunity to start getting rid of them.  Meanwhile, we try to make
sure that any new entries have no nicknames whenever possible.

One of the philosophical goals we were aiming for while working out
the structure of the domain name system was to end up with only ONE
name for any particular host, even though this site might exist on
different networks.  By using neutral top-level domains of COM, EDU,
and the like, we hoped to avoid a multiplicity of names resulting from
political claim staking (MC.MIT.ARPA = MC.MIT.CHAOS = MC.MIT.CSNET =
MC.MIT.DOE = etc etc) and to encourage the selection of just one name
which could then be used by all (or most) organizations and networks
using a particular host.  This is the underlying basis for the "no
domain nicknames" policy; it is not a technical problem, but rather a
philosophy which we think will make life easier in the long run (and
having maintained these lists for years, we do speak from experience).

What is now causing confusion is the fact that many people have used
the NIC host table as a way of vectoring their mail to different
places at different times, by shuffling nicknames around.  This is not
really how the table was meant to be used, and the creation of MF type
records in the domain name system is a reflection of the fact that
mail addressing is not the same as TELNET or FTP host addressing.

In the particular case that started all this, Bruce Nemnich wanted to
register GODOT.THINK.COM as an official name, with THINK.COM as a
nickname.  The intent here was to have every machine in the THINK.COM
domain fake up their return-path and sender-address to xyz@THINK.COM
which would then relay responses to the appropriate place.

Now, there is no inherent technical problem with simply sticking those
names in our database.  However, this request was initially rejected,
on the basis of our simple "no domain nickname" guideline, by the
staff members who serve as HOSTMASTER.  When later they anxiously
asked me for confirmation, I allowed as how "we could do it-- but it
would be wrong."

Remember, mailers are still required to use official host names in
anything which goes out.  Supposing that we carried out the THINK.COM
request, the THINK.COM hosts would be violating the requirement by
using the "THINK.COM" nickname as part of the return address in their
outgoing mail.  If they did this anyway, then any host which DOES
follow the rules when responding to these messages will generate
headers addressed NOT to THINK.COM, but to GODOT.THINK.COM.  And, of
course, anyone responding to the secondary headers will never have
seen any THINK.COM addresses!

The solution that was adopted was simply to make THINK.COM the
official name for one of their hosts.  No nicknames.

Note that as long as mail addresses are the equivalent of host
addresses, the domain name system will still need to remember "old"
names, so that the stuff in your mail files remains useful for a
reasonable time after some host has changed its name.  If people would
like to discuss this further, I suggest using the HEADER-PEOPLE
mailing list, as the problem is slightly more related to mail than to
the workings of domain name servers.  But since I used NAMEDROPPERS too
for this message, I'll understand if others go through the same vacillation and
settle on both...
