    The unanimous opinion of the notes (all but one of which also
went to namedroppers) I've gotten in response to my last letter
is that it makes sense to have both MD and MF records for a single host.
If people are willing, I'd like to take this discussion one step
further and nail down what we expect a mailer to do with with MD
and MF records.  The notes I got seemed to have pretty similar
ideas, and we might as well canonize it, before all the mail
systems come out with their own (different) rules.

    Here is the set of rules I think comes closest to what people
want (heavily borrowing from Paul Milazzo's message).  The two
key points are that the MFs are tried immediately, if the MD host
isn't reachable (no fancy delays, etc.) and that if a host
doesn't list any mail records, it is assumed to be its own
MD, while simply listing an MF says "always forward".

Here the rules I think people are headed towards:

    Given a host name a mailer should do a MAILA query on that
domain name.  If the MAILA query returns nothing look up the Internet
address of HOST.  If this lookup fails, reject the message, otherwise try
to deliver the message to the Internet address.

    If the MAILA query succeeded, first try to deliver to the MD host
(if any).  If you cannot reach the MD host, try any MF hosts listed.
Try to contact each MF until either there are no MFs remaining, or one
of them has accepted or rejected the message.  (Paul's idea of
not trying MFs on unreachable networks is a nice touch here).
