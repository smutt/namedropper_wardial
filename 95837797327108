GentlePeople,

I have enclosed a draft of a proposal that Bruce Cole and I
have been working on. This proposal describes how the internet DNS
can be used to aid in the storage/distribution of RFC 987, etc
mapping tables. These tables will be important to the interoperation
of RFC 822 based mail and OSI X.400 (MHS).

We will be discussing the proposal as part of the X.400 WG meeting at
the Vancouver IETF.

The proposal has been implemented and tested on a trial basis at
the University of Wisconsin.

Draft RFC                                                      May 1990


1.0 Introduction

     RFC987 describes a set of mappings between the X.400 (1984) series of
protocols and the RFC822 mail protocol, or protocols derived from RFC822.
That document addresses conversion of services, addresses, message envelopes,
and message bodies between the two mail systems.
     This draft RFC is concerned with one aspect of RFC987; the mechanism for
mapping between X.400 O/R addresses and RFC822 domain names.  As described in
Appendix F of RFC987, implementation of the mappings requires a database which
maps between X.400 O/R addresses and RFC822 addresses.  A possible mechanism
for use of the internet DNS to store, retrieve and maintain these mappings
is proposed.  This mechanism is of potential use to internet hosts acting as
X.400/RFC822 gateways.

Definitions

    dmn-orname: text encoding of O/R address as defined in
	section 4.1.3 of RFC987.  This representation of X.400 O/R
	addresses allows storage and retrieval of O/R addresses
	by the Internet DNS, without syntactical extensions to the DNS.

    domain-name: text encoding of a domain name

    &lt;domain-name&gt;: Internet DNS encoding of a domain name, as defined
	in RFC1035, section 3.3.

    owner-name: The name of a particular node in the DNS namespace to
	which one or more resource records belong.  Also known as
	the name field of a DNS resource record.

2.0 Motivation

     Implementations of RFC987 gateways require that a database store address
mapping information for X.400 and RFC822.  This information must be
disseminated to all RFC987 gateways.  In the internet community, the DNS has
proven to be a practical means for providing a distributed nameservice.
Advantages of using a DNS based system over a table based approach for mapping
between O/R addresses and domain names are:

	1. It avoids fetching and storing of entire mapping tables by
	every host that wishes to implement RFC987.

	2. Modifications to the DNS based mapping information can be made
	available in a more timely manner than with a table driven approach.

	3. Organizations avoid the administrative costs associated with
	maintaining mapping tables throughout their network.

	4. Allows the specification of backup gateways (in case of failure)
	through the use of a priority field.

3.0 Proposed Resource Records

     Using RFC987's assumption of an asymmetric mapping between X.400 and
RFC822 addresses, two separate relations are required to store the mapping
database.  We propose two new DNS resource record types, TO-X400 and TO-822,
which are to be used to translate between X.400 and RFC822 addresses.  The
owner-name field of the new resource records can be thought of as keys used to
reference the RFC987 mapping data.  The data format and meaning of these new
resource records is as follows:

TO-822 (resource record type 20, decimal)

    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                  PREFERENCE                   |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                WILDCARD-COUNT                 |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    /                 DOMAIN-NAME                   /
    /                                               /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

TO-X400 (resource record type 21, decimal)

    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                  PREFERENCE                   |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                WILDCARD-COUNT                 |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    /                  DMN-ORNAME                   /
    /                                               /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

where:

PREFERENCE      A 16 bit integer which specifies the preference given to
                this resource record among others of the same type and
		owner-name.  Lower values are preferred.

WILDCARD-COUNT	A 16 bit integer.  If the information being returned
		by this resource record is not derived from a wildcard
		resource record, then this field contains the value zero.
		Otherwise, this field indicates the number of components
		explicitly matched by a wildcard resource record.
		Specifically, a non-zero value N specifies that the rightmost N
		components of owner-name were used to find the wildcard
		resource record information.  Note that the value of this
		field is computed by authoritative nameservers, and is not
		specified in a master file for a zone.

Draft RFC                                                      May 1990


DOMAIN-NAME     A &lt;domain-name&gt; which specifies the domain-name of a host
		willing to receive RFC822 mail.

DMN-ORNAME      A &lt;domain-name&gt; which specifies the dmn-orname of a host
		willing to receive X.400 mail.

TO-X400:
     Given an owner-name representing an RFC-822 domain-name, return an
X400 O/R address in dmn-orname syntax.  There can be multiple TO-X400 records
associated with one owner-name, indicating a set of X.400/RFC822 gateways for
one domain name.  The preference field is used to indicate the relative
priorities of these multiple records.  In the event of a delivery failure, an
alternate X.400 gateway of equal or lesser priority can be chosen, such as is
done with the DNS MX resource records. (see RFC974).

TO-822:
     Given an owner-name representing an X.400 O/R address in dmn-orname
syntax, return an RFC-822 domain-name.  The preference and wildcard-count
fields are interpreted in the same manner as for TO-X400 records.

4.0 Usage

     The RFC987 mapping information is stored in the DNS in a tree structure.
The TO-X400 records occupy space within the already existent tree of domain
names.  The TO-822 records occupy a new tree whose nodes are domain names in
dmn-orname syntax.  O/R attributes are stored in the tree hierarchically with
the most significant attributes occupying root domains, and the least
significant attributes occupying leaf nodes of the DNS.  The root nodes of
this new tree represent O/R country attribute-value pairs.  For example, C$US
and C$UK are valid root domain names.

     The dmn-orname information associated with TO-X400 and TO-822 resource
records do not represent full O/R address, they are merely templates which
specify those fields of the O/R address that are used by the mapping
algorithm.  A subset of the possible X.400 O/R attributes are used when
performing conversions between RFC822 and X.400 O/R addresses.  The attribute
names allowed in a dmn-orname, listed in descending order of significance are:

Name				Number that may be specified in dmn-orname

Country				Exactly 1
ADMD				0 or 1
PRMD				0 or 1
Organization			0 or 1
Organizational Unit		0 or more

     When an O/R address is written in dmn-orname syntax, the attributes are
ordered from left to right in ascending order of significance.  O/R attribute
names not listed in the above table (such as the surname attribute) do not
appear in dmn-ornames used by the mapping procedure.  When an attribute is



Cole &amp; Hagens                                                   [Page 3]

Draft RFC                                                      May 1990


omitted from the dmn-orname, no other attributes of less significance may be
included.

     Dmn-ornames and domain-names are used as the lookup keys to retrieve
RFC987 mapping information from the DNS.  A non-existent domain response from
the nameserver indicates that there is no RFC987 mapping information in the
DNS for the given key, and the DNS search is complete.  A non-error response
also completes the DNS search.  Wildcard resource records can be used to
allow multiple keys to map to one node in the DNS namespace.  (See also
RFC1034, section 4.3.3, wildcards.)

     If the returned resource record contains a non-zero WILDCARD-COUNT field,
then the longest possible match of the supplied lookup key does not include
all components of that key.  For a lookup key of M components and a
WILDCARD-COUNT field with value N, a non-zero value for N indicates that the
leftmost M-N components of the lookup key were not explicitly matched.
Assumptions are made as to the mapping of the unmatched components.  There are
two cases:

1. RFC822-&gt;X.400
     Map all remaining domain-name components to additional O/R
attribute/value pairs.  The next attribute assigned corresponds to the
attribute of next lower priority than the lowest attribute type already
assigned.  The new attribute is assigned a value which is the same as the most
significant unmapped domain-name component.  If the last assigned attribute
type was an OU (organizational unit), then any additional attribute
assignments will be to OUs, with less significant attribute-value pairs
written to the left of other attribute-values.  Order and significance of
domain-name components are preserved by this scheme.

2. X.400-&gt;RFC822
     Of the remaining dmn-orname components, only those which correspond to
attributes at least as significant as the OU attribute type are mapped.  The
attribute values from these components are added to the domain-name returned
by the DNS lookup, and are mapped in the same order as they appear in the
dmn-orname.  Those attributes less significant than the OU attribute are used
in the construction of the left hand side of the RFC822 address.  The
translation of the left hand side of the 822 address is specified by RFC987.

Example:
    Assume DNS is populated with the following wildcard resource record:
    "*.OU$CS.O$UW-MADISON.PRMD$XNREN.ADMD$ .C$US."	IN TO-822 0 cs.wisc.edu

    Given the O/R address
    	/PRMD=XNREN/ADMD= /S=hagens/OU=DIP/OU=CS/O=UW-MADISON/C=US/
    determine the corresponding RFC822 domain name.

    Step 1. The address is rewritten in dmn-orname syntax as:
    	OU$DIP.OU$CS.O$UW-MADISON.PRMD$XNREN.ADMD$ .C$US
    (The /S=hagens attribute value pair is dropped since it is less significant



Cole &amp; Hagens                                                   [Page 4]

Draft RFC                                                      May 1990


    than an OU attribute.  The attribute order is rewritten according to the
    dmn-orname restriction specifications.)

    Step 2. Perform the DNS lookup:
    	"OU$DIP.OU$CS.O$UW-MADISON.PRMD$XNREN.ADMD$ .C$US."
    The nameserver returns the domain-name: cs.wisc.edu, with preference 0,
    and a wildcard-count of 5.

    Step 3. Since the wildcard-count field is non-zero, the nameserver
    response indicates that the dmn-orname component OU$DIP was not
    explicitly matched.  The unmapped attribute value "DIP" is prepended
    to the domain-name returned by the DNS lookup to produce the domain-name
    "dip.cs.wisc.edu".

     RFC987 specifies that translation from one address space to another may
occur in 2 ways. The above method of translation (lookup from the mapping
database) is used when sub-trees of the different name spaces are associated
via mapping information.  The fall back method of translation (encoding in the
other address space's format) is used when table lookup fails.  However, in
this case, the translation is less sophisticated.  The fall back method
amounts to encoding the address in the other system's format.  RFC987
specifies default rules that may be used to perform this encoding.  These
rules specify the manner in which an RFC822 address may be encoded in X.400,
and vice versa, by means of domain defined attributes.

5.0 Administration of mapping information

     Not all RFC987 gateways will be able to use the internet DNS to map
between O/R addresses and RFC822 domain names.  Hosts without access to the DNS
are expected to obtain full mapping tables (in RFC987 Appendix F format) from
a master table via RARE-WG1.  Hosts with DNS access should be able to obtain
full mapping information from the DNS namespace.  This implies that there will
be two separate copies of the mapping database, one in table form, and the
other within the internet DNS namespace.

Use by DNS sites:
     All TO-X400 and TO-822 records will be stored in DNS zones.  The
authoritative information for any particular zone may be delegated to any
nameserver supporting the TO-X400 and TO-822 resource records.  The root
nameservers for the TO-X400 and TO-822 information delegate zones to the
authoritative nameservers, and assume authority for those sections of the DNS
tree that have not been delegated.  Note that the root
nameservers for these records are not necessarily the same nameservers which
are root nameservers for the internet address class.  (See next section).
     For zones not already delegated to a nameserver, the root nameservers
will initialize these segments of the DNS tree with the mapping information
obtained via RARE WG1.  This allows DNS sites to receive up to date information
for data which is not maintained by the DNS.

Use by non DNS sites:



Cole &amp; Hagens                                                   [Page 5]

Draft RFC                                                      May 1990


     As mentioned, non DNS sites will obtain all their mapping
information using RARE-WG1.  In order for the master table-based version of
the database to be up to date and complete, changes made to the DNS version
must propagate into the table-based version.  DNS sites could use a program to
parse their zone files into tables formatted as in RFC987 Appendix F.  The
output could then be delivered to the site which maintains the master RARE-WG1
tables.


6.0 Which address class to use?

     It can be convenient for these records to be stored in the same DNS zones
as other resource record types, such as internet address records.  It seems
reasonable to store these records in the internet address class since the
TO-X400 records refer to owner-names which are already present in the internet
address class.  In our initial implementation of these new DNS records, the
records are assigned to the internet address class.
     Conceivably, these records could be placed in a new address class such as
an ISO address class.  This would allow the zones containing TO-X400 and
TO-822 records to be delegated independently of already existing DNS zones.
This could be particularly useful if it is desired to keep the root
nameservers for this mapping data separate from the current internet root
nameservers.  If these nameservers are not separate, then it is expected that
the existing root nameservers will be given the new burden of loading RARE WG1
information into the DNS.
     Note that the scope of wildcard resource records are bounded by the
presence of resource records that occupy subdomains of the wildcard
record.  If the scope of wildcard records is affected by resource records from
different address classes, then wildcard records can be affected in
non-intuitive ways.  For example the records:
    *.B.A.	IN	MX	0   B.A.
    C.B.A.	HS	TXT	"data"

would cause internet address class MX queries for any domain name ending in
C.B.A to not match the above wildcard record.  If a separate address class is
to be used for the TO-X400 and TO-822 records, it is preferable for wildcard
records to not be affected by resource records from other address classes.

7.0 Summary

     Internet DNS nameservers wishing to provide this mapping information need
to be modified to support two new resource record types, and possibly a new
address class.  Additional modifications are required to support the
WILDCARD-COUNT field used by the new resource record types.
     Usage of these extensions provide RFC987 gateways with the advantages
listed in the motivation section.  These advantages are important for the
administration of RFC987 gateways.
     The existence of two copies of the O/R address vs domain-name mapping
database is proposed.
