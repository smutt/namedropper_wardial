[A lot of really good suggestions..]
[I'll note that making MMDF respond to two different domain names on
 the same host is pretty easy.. Mostly just a matter of listing both
 of the names in the "local channel" table.]

&gt;That should do it for the short term.  Over time, you'll probably want to
&gt;wean correspondents off of "bioimage.com".  The CNAME record pointing to
&gt;"maize.millipore.com" should take care of most of that - a large proportion
&gt;of correspondents simply reply to messages.  The rest is really a PR issue.

There is a technique, which happens to be pretty trivial to do in MMDF,
which would help in getting your correspondants weaned.  You fix up
your mailer so that it recognizes certain names and sends back mail to
the sender.

In MMDF this is done with the blockaddr channel.  You tell it a list of
either domain names or full user addresses (user@domain) and a text file
containing the message to send.  Whenever mail passes by for one of them 
It shuffles a message off to wherever..

You may remember the CSNET conversion a few years ago.  This was the cause
of all those nice letters everybody received telling 'em about the change.

(For those who don't know:  CSNET used to use ".csnet" as it's top level
`domain' name, and a couple of years ago they pushed all their customers
to switch to "real" domain names.)

I *assume* a similar thing can be done with sendmail :-)


&gt;You're lucky that Bioimage had such a small domain.  I once had to do this
&gt;with a much larger one.

heh.. I can imagine..  Apollo wasn't (isn't?) small.
