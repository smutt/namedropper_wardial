Jon, I think you're being a bit too flippant about this issue.
When you say:

	Well, we have been doing this for 16 years and so far have used about 70 of
	the 256 ports ...

You are referring only to the ports listed in "Assigned Numbers".
"Assigned Numbers" only lists assignments that apply to
all members of the Internet community.  Many other assignments are
made by local, bilateral or multilateral agreements.  This is altogether
fitting and proper.

Internet specs do not take any notice of such "private" assignments except to
require they be greater than 255, to avoid conflict with possible future
Internet assignments.  That is also fitting and proper.

On the other hand, the decision to represent WKS data as a bitmask
actively interferes with private agreements by making
it more difficult to use nameservers to support them.
First, it means that any WKS record that wishes to mention a private
port number must have at least 33 bytes of bitmap.  So far, no big deal.
But suppose some community wishes to establish a multilateral agreement
to allocate another block of port numbers for its use.  For example,
Berkeley UNIX only allows privileged processes to listen on port
numbers less than 1024.  They then use numbers in the range from 256 to
1023 for UNIX-specific services like printer spooling, quote-of-the day,
and others that are not Internet standards, but are standard within
the Berkeley UNIX community.  Now WKS records that want to name a "private"
port need at least 129 bytes.  Still more specific applications
(such as the Ingres database system) use ports outside this range.
Users working on an experimental application are thus encouraged to use very
large port numbers to avoid conflicts.  There was no reason why
large numbers shouldn't be used until RFC882 came along.

I have additional concerns about the following sentence from RFC882:
"If less than 256 bits are present, the remainder are assumed to be zero."
First, it encourages implementors to build software that cannot handle
more than 32 bytes of bitmap.  Second, it is not clear what to do
if there are MORE than 256 bits present.  At the very least, the
sentence should be re-written, "Bits not explicitly present are assumed
to be zero".

As everybody keeps pointing out, this isn't a huge issue (but at least
it's more interesting than debating top-level domain names :-).
It wouldn't even be worth mentioning except that there's a very simple
solution:  Instead of a bit-map, use a sequence of integers.
256 may seem to be huge number of ports, but then again, I can remember
when 64 seemed like a huge number of imps!
