&gt; Soon, I will have to bring up a couple of Suns in a subnet/department

&gt; administered domain name servers.  I do not want to use any aspect of
&gt; yp that is not present in bind.  So I don't need yp. right? :-)

  Sorry fot the late response.  You've probably already received dozens of
replies to your query, but I'll shoot this off just in case.

  What you want to do is edit /etc/rc.local and change the invocation of
/usr/etc/ypserv.  There are two lines invoking ypserv in the rc.local
distributed by Sun.  One of them is commented out and the other is not.
The one which is commented out is only different in that it has a "-i"
option added.  This tells ypserv to ask the name server for any host names
it can't figure out.  Just switch the commenting and set up the name
server files (/etc/named.boot, etc.) as you would normally.

  There is one problem with doing this: the name server will return a
timeout if it is unable to get the information you requested, but the YP
protocol has no mechanism to return this time out to the requesting
client, so it does nothing.  Ypbind will send requests to ypserv
continuously until it gets a response. assuming that it's request was
lost If your name server is generating time out responses because your
gateway to the internet is down, this means you have an infinite loop (or
at least a very large one terminated when your gateway comes back up).

  Normally this isn't a problem since most of the clients requesting name
or address resolution are things like telnet, ftp, etc. and the users
invoking those programs eventually type ^C and try again later.  But if
the client is sendmail, it doesn't get tired (Sun OS 3.5 and earlier).
Eventually you'll get dozens of sendmail processes locked in loops
sending requests to your ypserv.  The machine running ypserv will get
very tired because of the dozens of ypservs being forker per second.  Its
load average will climb up to about 16 and it will then throw up and
crash (Sun OS 3.4 at least).

  Bill Nowicki at Sun (nowicki@sun.com) can provide you with a couple of
new versions of the sendmail binary that will solve this problem.  One is
simply a slightly fixed version of the standard binary that has timeouts
around the gethostbyname, etc. calls, and the other is a version of
sendmail which supports MX records and goes directly to the name server
bypassing ypserv.  If you want to get the fullest use out of your name
server, you'll go with the second.  It's trivial to put a
/etc/resolv.conf on all your Sun clients directing them to use a name
server either on your Sun file server or another machine to avoid
clogging poor Sun 3/50's memories with immense name server processes.

  By the way, the timeouts that Bill added to the standard sendmail are
90 seconds.  Much too long in my opinion.  This is far longer than the
name server's time out period and if you can't make a connection to your
ypserv in 30 seconds, something is seriously screwed up.  But it doesn't
hurt anything especially.  Just be aware of it when you watch things
happening so you know that the long trail of forked ypservs (90 seconds
worth) is ok ...
