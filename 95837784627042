A few days ago i received a message from Paul Mockapetris (relayed to
me and the other recipients of this message by Jon Postel).  In it Mr
Mockapetris pointed out a number of systems that had both undue DNS
traffic on NIC.DDN.MIL and some sort of misconfiguration in their own
name domains.  I'm responsible for the configuration of
DURER.CME.NBS.GOV, which had the highest traffic figure and appeared
to be lacking an in-addr.arpa reverse-name resolution entry.  In the
intervening two days i tracked down the problems and am sending out
this message to detail what i found and what i did about it.

First of all, i had in fact failed to make an entry for the name
server in its in-addr.arpa files - in fact, i only excluded the name
server, all my other hosts were reverse-resolvable.  I don't know why
i originally excluded the name server machine from the entries, but
expect it was an early misunderstanding that went by unnoticed when i
eventually knew better.  The solution to this was simply to add the
entry.

The other problem was more tricky.  I guessed that my name service was
routing queries to the root name servers extremely frequently, and set
about tracking down what exactly was happening.  By examining the log
produced when running 'named' in debug mode i discovered that it was
incessantly redispatching a query concerning a system named
"econ.vu.nl" to the root servers.  However, i couldn't see where the
queries were coming in from - that didn't show up in my log file.

On mentioning this in a note to Craig Hunt, the central network
coordinator here at NIST, he informed me that "econ.vu.nl" has only
one server (contrary to the rfc's), "star.cs.vu.nl", and that that
server is not responding.  (I don't know what magic Craig invoked to
track down this tidbit info, but it was certainly helpful to know
about it.) This aberration could easily explain why the requests were
never getting resolved (one way or another).  I still didn't know
where the requests were originating or why they kept occurring.

Eventually i took the step of taking a hex-dump sample of around 4000
packets using the Sun OS 'etherfind' utility (in /usr/etc), and
searching for references to "econ.vu.nl" in the hex code.  With the
help of a buddy here we found one machine that had non-'domain'
packets with references to that name. (We were not concerned with
'domain' packets because they were all part of the various name
servers correspondance about resolving the name).  On logging in to
that machine i discovered an orphaned 'finger' process to "econ" that
a researcher (from another installation) had accidentally left going a
few days ago.  Evidentally this finger process was perpetually
flogging the name server to resolve the name, to the tune of two to
three resends every ten seconds.  Killing this orphaned process
stopped all the extra commotion almost immediately, and speaking with
the researcher and asking him to check another way to determine
whether 'econ' is reachable should keep this version of the problem
from reoccuring.

So, the problems that Paul Mockapetris reported were a combination of
misconfiguration and peculiar use of the name server.  While i should
have caught the absence of a reverse-resolution entry for my name
server in it's data base, i don't see how i could have configured
things any better to prevent the undue loading of the NIC that he
refers to.  Apparently, for reasons i can't explain, the name server
was unable to supply 'finger' with the information that the site it
was seeking was unreachable, and 'finger' never gave up.

Thanks to Don Libes, Bill Anderson, and Craig Hunt for misc
information and assistance in tracking down this bizarreness.
