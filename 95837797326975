               ... . Intentionally there are two zones for the de.
   domain, one is the official internet zone, and lists all those
   subdomains in de that have aquired full internet connectivity only,
   and MX records for the other domains. This zone is serveres
   primarily by uunet.uu.net, with the other US servers being secondary
   for that zone.

   The other zone, that contains all information about the ever changing
   accessible netz in germany is on unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de.
   Sites using the DNS in germany usually have a forward onto
   that machine to get all those domainnames correctly resolved.

   The reasons for this are obviously that we still cannot enter domains
   in  the official DNS zones, that are not US-internet connected.

The way the de. domain is set up now IS a kind of lie. Furthermore, no
one has seen fit to tell sites in other parts of Europe of the setup,
although we have better routing to the German net: From our site (in
Denmark) we can reach two of the three IP addresses that unido
advertises for tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de. .

I think that if a host has an official IP number it should be in the
DNS even if it is not connected to anything. When people try to
connect they will get an ICMP Host/Net Unreachable message from the
nearest gateway, which will tell them what the real problem is and
keep them from bothering the domain administrator. (In the Danish part
of NORDUNET we have had several active subnets with no Internet
connectivity; these were announced in the DNS, and no one complained
that I know of.)

In our case, as we won't (and shouldn't) forward queries to unido, we
can only let the resolver have this information if we set one of our
BIND's up as a secondary for de. with unido as the primary. If this
practice proliferates, each site on the net may have to change its
nameserver setup on a daily basis if it wants to keep up with routing
changes all over the network: Changes no one informs about.

Maybe the NIC should be charged with maintaining a SERVERS.TXT which
tells where to get the supplementary information which cannot be had
through the root servers.
