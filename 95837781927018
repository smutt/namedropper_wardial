Dave,
Aren't you just pushing the problem somewhere else by suggesting that we
should be using user objects to find mail drops?  I agree with you that
using user objects delays a binding that we want to delay and allows us to
collect information about users in a single place, but the naming problem
still exists.  In this case we need to be able to name and find user
objects and the scope and nature of this problem is the same as naming and
finding mailboxes or maildrops.  The same problems of naming and finding
things reliably will occur whether we are trying to resolve rather
statically bound names for maildrops or user objects over the same size and
nature (widely distributed and under multiple authorities) domain.  I don't
think that the problems that you've been reporting with domain name
resolution are related to the reasons for late binding to maildrops (eg the
mobility of people or unreliability of maildrop repositories) and therefore
the related need to bind to maildrops late in the game.  I agree with you
that user objects would be beneficial, but I don't agree with you that they
will solve the problems of managing or using the namespace that you have
been addressing.  I also agree with you that the problems you are
addressing need to be solved.
