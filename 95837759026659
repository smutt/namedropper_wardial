    Pardon me for submitting this to two lists, but it looks like
this may never have reached header-people (it has been 21 hours -- which
is a bit long) and recent correspondence with some people suggests that
it might be more appropriate on namedroppers (since it is fundamentally
a domain problem).  If people disagree we can redirect discussion to
the appropriate group.

    I recently found myself wrestling with a mail related problem
which I thought people on this list might (1) find interesting and
(2) possibly shed new light on.  The problem is complex, and doesn't
explain well without examples, so bear with me....

    As some of you may know it looks as if, in addition to the Internet
and CSNET, some substantial subset of the UUCP network and BITNET will
convert to using domain names.  To make things more complicated, it
also looks as if each of the physical networks (Internet, CSNET, UUCP
and BITNET) will probably use slightly different systems for resolving
domain names (UUCP will probably use tables on each machine, CSNET
will at least partially relay on tables maintained on CSNET-RELAY along
with the Internet domain database, etc.).  As a result, we are no
longer going to be able to route mail based on names (.UUCP and .CSNET)
or even format ('!' vs '%' or '@').

    Having set up my stage, here's the basic problem.  There are several
hosts which offer gateway service between the different mail networks.
For example CSNET-RELAY (aka RELAY.CS.NET) between CSNET and the Internet,
and SEISMO.CSS.GOV between UUCP and the Internet.  How are these gateways
to decide how to route mail to a host, if that host is on more than
one administrative network?

    For example, imagine A.ATT.COM (a phoney host name).  ATT.COM is/will
be on both CSNET and UUCP, and thus A.ATT.COM can be reached through
either network.  Now I am on LOKI.BBN.COM, an Internet host, and
mail to JOE@A.ATT.COM.  My mailer, since I am only on the Internet,
queries the domain database and finds the following information (which
is purely hypothetical -- I do not know which way ATT may choose
to route their mail):

    ; mail thru RELAY preferred over SEISMO
    *.ATT.COM.	IN	MX	10	RELAY.CS.NET.   ; CSNET relay
    *.ATT.COM.	IN	MX	20	SEISMO.CSS.GOV. ; UUCP gateway

it tries to deliver to RELAY and fails and passes the message instead
of SEISMO.  Now what is SEISMO supposed to do?  It is on the Internet,
so it could wait for RELAY (the preferred Internet relay) to come up
and then pass the message on to RELAY, or since it is on UUCP along
with ATT, SEISMO can choose to send the message via UUCP.  Which
is SEISMO expected to do?  I'm sort of inclined to say it sends to
ATT via UUCP, despite the fact this may surprise people on the Internet.
In other words, once mail reaches a gateway host it is considered to
have crossed into the new network (if that makes sense).

    But there are odd problems with this system.  What happens to mail
for ATT originating on SEISMO.  SEISMO is an Internet host, and the
domain system indicates that given their druthers, ATT would like Internet
mail routed via CSNET.  Should SEISMO send to RELAY.CS.NET? 

    More generally, the system suggests that mail within an administrative
domain will tend to stay there. Mail originating within CSNET and destined
for a host which is both on CSNET and UUCP, will stay within CSNET.  The
CSNET relay, having been conditioned to believe that mail sent to it is
destined for CSNET will not consult the Internet domain database for
information about hosts it knows how to reach.

    Does this feel like the right way to do things at the gateways?
Has anyone got better suggestions?  Let me point out one small restriction
here for those who have better ideas -- some mail systems split apart
the functions of receiving and sending mail -- so it is highly likely
that at the time the CSNET relay (or some other mail gateway) is 
deciding where to send a message, it probably no longer knows from
what network the message came in from (particularly if the names in
the headers no longer convey this information).  So any scheme which
says "if it comes in from this net, try to send it out the other net"
probably doesn't work.
