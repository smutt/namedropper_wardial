Joe,

Experience around CMU has shown is that a relative name resolving
algorithm that is independent of some type of database does not
work within a mildly adminstrative name space. We used to have
such an independent algorithm but got into trouble because we
have a CS.CMU.EDU, RI.CMU.EDU, ECE.CMU.EDU, FAC.CS.CMU.EDU,
WARP.CS.CMU.EDU, ASSY.RI.CMU.EDU, etc. name space with nicknames
or bottom levels names that were unique in most cases. The non-unique
cases killed our hopes....preferences were dependent on the requestor.

Another way is to look at the following two cases:

    One of the old communial timesharing machines is called the "A"
    by local people. A project starts up and has lots of machines and
    prefers to call four of them A, B, C and D because of some reason
    (say it is a multiprocessor with four processors). Because the
    domain system has global names you can't deny them the "A" but
    it causes problems with the name space.

    The solution at CMU was that people using these machines would
    see their "A" first in the search and people not using the machine
    would see the communial "A" machine.

    But given that the project was a subdomain called FOO and many of the
    old machines did not have subdomains, the algorithm had to actually
    go down a subdomain. For instance, I am on "A.CS.CMU.EDU" and their
    is a machine called "RUDY.FAC.CS.CMU.EDU", the algorithm should
    "see" RUDY if I telnet from A.CS.CMU.EDU since RUDY is a fairly
    unique name across most of the three departments: ECE, CS and RI.

Isn't it great dealing with such a human and contradicting thing like
names and nicknames! A salesmen calls me Mr Nedved, the credit card
companies call my E Rudolph Nedved and my friends call me Rudy.
