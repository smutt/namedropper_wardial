Regarding whether FTP should be shown in the WKS information via bit 20
or bit 21:

I believe the use of bit 20 to denote FTP in the WKS info was an inten-
tional decision rather than an oversight.  Since, by definition, both
ports 20 and 21 must be used together by any working FTP implementation,
it really makes no difference at all which one is used in the WKS list
-- as long as everyone agrees on whatever choice is made.

Paul Mockapetris decided to use WKS bit 20 for FTP.  I suggested to him
that bit 21 might be the more logical choice, since this corresponds to
the "control" port.  He evidently felt this was not a sufficient reason
to change things -- and though I still feel that bit 21 would be a
marginally better choice, I for one am willing to go along with his
decision in the matter.

Again, it really shouldn't matter from a theoretical standpoint whether
we all decide to use bit 20, or whether we all decide to use bit 21.
The important issue is that everyone must agree to use one or the other.

I can see no justifiable reason, by the way, to use both bits 20 and 21
together.  After all, what we have here is a single service which hap-
pens to use two ports.  Would WKS bit 21 alone imply that the host's
FTP server will handle commands, but won't establish data connections?
Assuming that both ports of a multi-port service should be listed in the
WKS info, what would bit 20 alone imply??

Presumably, any software which uses the WKS info (is there any right
now?  I doubt it, but would love to be pleasantly surprised) would be
set up to use a text file to map WKS names and numbers together.  The
programs concerned could then simply talk about the "FTP" or "TCP/FTP"
service, without having to worry about the actual numeric offset of the
WKS service bit being queried.
